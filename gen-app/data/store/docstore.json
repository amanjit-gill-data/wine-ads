While the external environment continued to present challenges in some markets, the fundamentals of our strategy remain sound, with strong demand in the luxury wine segment driving progress towards our ambition of being the world\u2019s most admired premium wine company.  \nDear shareholders, \nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Annual Report for Treasury Wine \nEstates Limited. \nThis has been a year of continued profit and EBITS margin growth \ndespite difficult global economic and geo-political circumstances. \nWhile the challenging environment has continued the trend of recent \nyears, our clear strategy, diversified business model and disciplined \nexecution has seen our iconic brands continue to grow in key markets \nin Asia (excluding Mainland China), the Americas, Australia, Europe, \nand further afield. \nGuided by our TWE2025 strategy while being agile and proactive \nin responding to shifts in the external environment, we continue \nto leverage the opportunities before us. Our activity this year has \nfocused on investment behind our priority brands and innovation \nagenda, expanding our multi-country of origin portfolios, optimising \nour global asset footprint, and making organisational change that allows us to improve our efficiency. The re-allocation of investment  \nto where it will best support growth in the current and future \ncommercial environment has, and will continue to, deliver cost\n  \nand structural benefits.\nWith our brand portfolio operating model now firmly in place, we\u2019ve\n \nseen a clear focus on execution from each division: Penfolds, Treasury \nPremium Brands, and Treasury Americas. The premiumisation trend has continued across all our markets, informing our approach to \nattracting new consumers into the category and expanding the occasions that our portfolio satisfies for existing ones. \nPenfolds has cemented its position as a global luxury icon, continuing \nthe tradition of engaging wine lovers and new consumers in \ninnovative ways: from premium after-sales experiences including wine certification through re-corking clinics to Penfolds House events \naround the world that bring together the best of wine, music, and design. Underpinning the brand\u2019s appeal in established and emerging \nmarkets is the focus on quality; the renowned Penfolds House Style.  \nA new tier in the Penfolds range \u2013 \u2018One by Penfolds\u2019 \u2013 was launched \nin September 2022 as a dynamic way of engaging the \u2018new luxurian\u2019\n \nconsumer with wines from the US, France, and for the first time - China. One by Penfolds leverages the brand as a hallmark for heritage, and \nrealises our long-held ambition to make wine in China. The China red blend, featuring grapes from the Ningxia region of China, is now \navailable alongside the US and French wines after the Hong Kong \nlaunch in early F24.  \nEnhancing production capacity to satisfy growing global demand for Penfolds informed our acquisition of a majority stake in the historic\n \nCh\u00e2teau Lanessan in Bordeaux, France, which completed in F23. The acquisition has doubled the production capacity for French-sourced \nPenfolds, and we have been collaborating closely with the Ch\u00e2teau\u2019s \nwinemakers and the Bouteiller family, which retains a minority stake. \nPlans are underway for the transformation of the historic site, founded \nin the late 18th century, into a cohesive blend of Penfolds storied \nhistory of almost 180 years and the brand\u2019s future focus in Europe, in \nthe heart of France\u2019s premier winemaking region. \nWith the increasing consumer interest in lighter red wines, we also \ncompleted the acquisition of Beenak Vineyard in Victoria\u2019s Yarra \nValley, which has significant plantings of cool-climate varieties \nincluding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. We also made the difficult \ndecision to close the Karadoc commercial winery in Victoria, Australia, \nin F24. Wines made at the Karadoc site will continue to be produced \nlocally through third party partnerships, allowing us to continue to \nfocus our capital  investment into premium and luxury winemaking.  \nThis year, Treasury Premium Brands has grown demand across \nAsia, in particular south-east Asia, with priority brands Pepperjack, \nSquealing Pig, 19 Crimes, and Rawson\u2019s Retreat strengthening consumer engagement.

In light of this, TWE will take \na measured approach to the phasing of Penfolds shipments across all markets to retain the flexibility of its global distribution and pricing model, which is planned to result in \nPenfolds EBITS being weighted to the second half in F24.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2707, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78a67dd7-6b71-4016-a7a4-a62cc30bdc5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "78a67dd7-6b71-4016-a7a4-a62cc30bdc5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c28930bd-4ac5-4d81-bbf4-757292d53456", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "dd56241a8916f478cec7a08fa9cf1acdef08acd96945772666c0ef3fbd4219f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ood understanding     Working knowledgeMaterial business risks\nVarious risks could have a material impact on the achievement  \nof TWE\u2019s strategies and future prospects.

This experience reinforced our leadership attributes and was an opportunity for leaders to practice creating a greater sense of belonging \nand develop a deeper appreciation of the role of connection \nin building an inclusive culture.  \n\u2022\n To build future leaders, Empower Me, TWE\u2019s development \nprogram for females and non-binary employees, was \nexpanded to include new and emerging leaders from \nunder-represented groups across the business. During 2023 \na total of 30 employees were enrolled in the program and are encouraged to take leadership roles within Employee \nResource Groups (ERGs) and represent TWE publicly.\nEngaged employees, consumers and communities\n\u2022\n To position IE&D within Supply in Australia as business critical\n \nand an intrinsic part of our Employee Value Proposition, as well as encouraging the involvement of Supply employees, a Supply \nIE&D governance structure was established. This structure is led by the Chief Supply Officer and members of the Supply \nLeadership Team, who review and support plans to build \nengagement. For example, members of the Supply Leadership \nTeam led an ERG roadshow, visiting all Supply sites and providing \neducation sessions to show how IE&D is relevant to all employees \nirrespective of location, and how ERGs can support employees \nto feel a sense of belonging. In the US, IE&D and the ERG topics \nhave been included in front line supervisory training for new and \ndeveloping front line leaders.  44.5%\n0.4% DECREASE\n42.8%\n1.3% INCREASEFemales in  \nleadership roles\nFemales in  \nall rolesF23 progress on diversity targets Our commitment to inclusion,  \nequity and diversity\nF23 progress towards the IE&D Strategy\nThe Company\u2019s IE&D plan is built on the foundations established in \nrecent years and focuses on IE&D being leader-led, integrated into the way that we work and inclusive of all employees.

The remuneration report is designed to demonstrate strong \nalignment between our Company\u2019s performance, our executive \nreward framework, our strategic objectives and shareholder interests.\nThis is my first letter to Shareholders as the Chair of the Human \nResources Committee. I would like to acknowledge Warwick  \nEvery-Burns\u2019 contribution to the Board and leadership of the Human \nResources Committee from May 2011 to October 2022.\nF23 performance\nWe are very pleased with the overall momentum of the business\n \nand the progress toward delivering our long term strategies under our CEO Tim Ford\u2019s leadership. Despite challenging economic and \ntrading conditions globally, all divisions continued to build quality \ndistribution, expand in key markets, and drive consumer demand. \nThe management team demonstrated exceptional leadership, \nresilience, agility and tenacity, consistently turning challenges into \nopportunities while positioning the Company for future growth. \nNotably, the team\u2019s continued efforts to premiumise our business have paid off, with 85% of our revenues now coming from our premium and luxury portfolios.\nIn F23, Management delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase \non the prior year, and EBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points \nto 24.1%. Net Sales Revenue (NSR) per case increased 12.7% led by \npremiumisation and price rises delivered across all divisions. TWE \ndelivered Earnings per Share (EPS) of 52.1 cents per share (before \nmaterial items and SGARA), up 16.6% from F22. ROCE increased from\n10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued \ncapital discipline.\nWith a solid foundation in place, we have great confidence in the \nambition, strategy and executional discipline of our leadership team \nthat will enable TWE to deliver sustainable growth and outperform the market over the long term.\nF23 executive remuneration outcomes \nIn F23, all executives received a 3% increase to fixed remuneration. \nThe Board also approved a 3% increase to Board Chair and Member \nbase fees and a moderate increase to Committee fees effective from 1 July 2022. Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) outcomes reflect \nthe level of business performance and range between 35%-72% of \nfixed remuneration, and 30%-40% of maximum opportunity. The F21 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) had an adjusted vesting of 78.75% of \nthe total target grant value.\nIn 2022 and 2023, I participated in numerous meetings with investors \n(representing over 60% of capital) and proxy advisors to discuss \nwhether our programs were fit for purpose and working as intended, \nparticularly in light of several material, one-off events entirely", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84d8215c-8657-49cd-bc97-e0e3fee9e87a": {"__data__": {"id_": "84d8215c-8657-49cd-bc97-e0e3fee9e87a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42f36751-28f9-43a9-87c5-f15d5892b5ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "9fc9e95f60e1e09aab4dc7855e109126598e190c12679cb1cf83a9cb57ede14c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "942f8f1b-ca51-4c9d-b87f-51b775e2f95e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c879acffb26e2448c4bdddb6400a70f0173895de35f99f0e05ed750a9403ca1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "59\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\noutside of management\u2019s control that materially impacted financial \nresults. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, \nand wildfires in California which reduced our access to luxury supply, \nthe imposition of tariffs on Australian wine in 2020 effectively closed \nthe China market \u2013 our largest and most profitable market at the time - overnight. In the face of these extraordinary events, executives were once again tasked in F23 with aggressive stretch goals to \npivot the business and mitigate impacts by driving growth in other markets and focusing on delivering quality growth in earnings. \nDespite their tremendous successes in F23 and over the past three \nyears, it has proven virtually impossible to achieve alignment \nbetween pay, TWE\u2019s strategic objectives, financial performance \nand shareholder returns. Outcomes for our executives - and for our \nshareholders - have not reflected alignment with what we believe to \nbe outstanding performance by our team. The cumulative impact \nof these external headwinds directly resulted in no STIP payments for \nF20, and nil vesting of the LTIP for three straight years in a row (2020, \n2021 and 2022). \nWhile we believe that STIP outcomes in F23 appropriately reward \nour executives,  the impacts of these events have once again \nimpacted both the relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) and \nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE) measures in the F21 LTIP, \nresulting in a significantly reduced rTSR payout and what would \notherwise be a fourth year of a nil payout on ROCE. I was very encouraged to hear once again during our investor meetings \nin 2023 that our shareholders overwhelmingly agreed with our \nassessment regarding the team\u2019s performance, and also agreed \nthat a compelling rationale warranted action by the Board to reward \nperformance and remedy the otherwise inequitable outcome under \nthe existing plan in place.\nPrincipled approach to adjusting the ROCE outcome in the F21 LTIP\nAs outlined in this report, after careful consideration of numerous \nalternatives and factors, extensive consultation throughout this \nprocess with our independent consultant, and in light of the \ncompelling results and the imperative to retain and motivate our \nleadership team, the Board made the unanimous decision to adjust \nonly the ROCE outcome (and not rTSR), and moreover, to adjust \nthe ROCE outcome only for the direct impact of the imposition of \nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) tariffs (and to exclude the other material, unanticipated events including the pandemic and \nwildfires). The resulting payouts are at 39% for the rTSR component \n(unadjusted and weighted at 25%) and 92% for the ROCE component (as adjusted for the MOFCOM tariffs only and weighted at 75%), with \ntotal vesting of the F21 LTIP at 78.75% of the target grant value.  \nFirst off, we determined that the F21 LTIP was the appropriate vehicle, \ngiven this plan includes the entire leadership team in place who\n \nwere tasked in F22 and F23 with aggressive stretch goals to pivot the business and mitigate these impacts. Moreover, the F21 LTIP is the final plan which did not account for the MOFCOM tariffs. While a \ncompelling rationale existed to adjust for other material, unforeseen events outside the control of management, we ultimately decided \nto focus exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs, with an eye toward both \nacknowledging the impacts on our investors as well as balancing \nthe interests and outcomes of all stakeholders. In addition, focusing exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs in our analysis enabled us to \nundertake a robust, objective, and comprehensive evaluation of the \ndirect impacts of the tariffs since 2020 as well as the direct results of aggressive mitigation strategies. Finally, we strongly believe that this award has been earned by the team.\nRest assured, this decision was not taken lightly. The circumstances \nsurrounding these events and the direct impact the tariffs had on \nthe performance of the Company were carefully considered over the course of many months, as well as the impact on shareholder \nreturns. As opposed to merely \u2018balancing\u2019 executives\u2019 and \nshareholders\u2019 interests, we strongly believe that the decisions we \nhave taken directly align the best interests of our executives and \nshareholders alike.  After much deliberation, the Board and Human \nResources Committee unanimously concluded that this was simply \nthe right thing to do - for all of our stakeholders.\nF23 activities of the Human Resources Committee \nDuring the year, we developed and formalised TWE\u2019s Executive Remuneration Framework and Strategy and also focused on remuneration policies and initiatives throughout the organisation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "942f8f1b-ca51-4c9d-b87f-51b775e2f95e": {"__data__": {"id_": "942f8f1b-ca51-4c9d-b87f-51b775e2f95e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42f36751-28f9-43a9-87c5-f15d5892b5ec", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "9fc9e95f60e1e09aab4dc7855e109126598e190c12679cb1cf83a9cb57ede14c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84d8215c-8657-49cd-bc97-e0e3fee9e87a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "f474ab960637ec08ba1603db24d0f679a668b6a99304c9670d97d8b5fc7a3bdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Finally, we strongly believe that this award has been earned by the team.\nRest assured, this decision was not taken lightly.

The premiumisation trends \ncontinue across the wine category with luxury wine continuing \nstrong growth trends in all of TWE\u2019s key global markets. Management \nexecuted strongly during the year and our diversified business model, \ntogether with the benefits of key asset base and cost optimisation \ninitiatives, have resulted in a resilient premium wine category despite \nthe tightening economic environment. \nIn F23, Management delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase \non the prior year, and EBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points \nto 24.1%. Net Sales Revenue (NSR) per case increased 12.7% led by \npremiumisation and price rises delivered across all divisions.  \nTWE delivered Earnings per Share (EPS) of 52.1 cents per share (before \nmaterial items and SGARA), up 16.6% from F22. ROCE increased from\n \n10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued capital \ndiscipline.\nDespite continued supply chain and cost headwinds, and changing \nconsumer and market dynamics, consumer demand for luxury wine \nremains strong in all markets globally, with luxury sales in the Penfolds, \nTreasury Americas and Treasury Premium Brands divisions in line \nwith expectations.

The Group\u2019s rTSR performance was at the 51st percentile of its peer group, driving an unadjusted outcome of 39% \nvesting for this component of the LTIP (weighted at 25%). \nWith respect to ROCE performance, however, and despite \nmanagement\u2019s successes in pivoting the business and driving \nsustainable earnings, aggressive cost management and operational \neffectiveness, the impacts of the pandemic, the wildfires in the US and \nthe introduction of the MOFCOM tariffs, without otherwise adjusting \nfor any of these factors, resulted in the ROCE component falling once \nagain below threshold.\nGiven the clear disconnect between the underlying assumptions \nmade when targets were originally set in 2020 and what thereafter \ntranspired (ie the COVID pandemic, wildfires and imposition of \nMOFCOM tariffs in China), the Committee and Board ultimately \nconcluded that a clear and compelling rationale existed to warrant \nan adjustment to the ROCE outcome to ensure that the intent and \nintegrity of the plan was maintained. \nThe Committee and Board has undertaken a comprehensive analysis \nof a number of identified principles which we believe were pertinent \nto our analysis, including: (a) whether the intent and integrity of the plan, while ensuring fair outcomes for Management, could be \nmaintained; (b) whether external business and economic factors beyond the control of Management which have materially impacted performance have occurred; (c) whether unforeseen, non-recurring factors occurred during the performance period which have materially impacted performance; (d) management\u2019s efforts and results to mitigate the impacts of the factors outlined above; (e) the \nlonger-term, sustainable impact of decisions and actions made by \nmanagement in the short-term; (f) whether budgetary assumptions made when setting performance targets were accurate and remain \nappropriate, and whether conditions are potentially better or worse \nwhen compared with those assumptions; (g) the degree of difficulty \nand complexity associated with achieving the targets, as related to \nboth the internal and external environment; and (h) alignment with \nthe interest of shareholders. \nWhile a compelling rationale existed to adjust for other material, \nunforeseen events outside the control of management, the \nCommittee and Board ultimately decided to focus exclusively on the \nMOFCOM tariffs and the success of mitigation initiatives, with an eye \ntoward both acknowledging the impacts on our investors as well as \nbalancing the interests and outcomes of all stakeholders. In addition, focusing exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs enabled us to undertake \na robust and objective  evaluation of the direct impacts of the tariffs \nsince 2020 as well as the direct results of aggressive mitigation strategies. \nThe unanticipated introduction of the MOFCOM tariffs clearly \nconstitutes an external business and economic factor beyond the control of management which materially impacted performance. \nMoreover, this event was unforeseen and non-recurring in nature, and budgetary assumptions made when setting performance targets \nwere no longer rendered accurate or appropriate. Management, has \nbeen highly successful in aggressively mitigating these impacts by \nexecuting both near term strategies as well as sustainable, strategic \ninitiatives for the longer term. Given that budgetary assumptions \nmade when setting targets proved to be inaccurate, the intent \nand integrity of the F21 LTIP was clearly compromised such that fair outcomes could not be achieved without an adjustment. Moreover, \nthe results achieved in the face of multiple obstacles highlight the strength and resilience of our global business and management\u2019s \nability to navigate the complex and changing economic, consumer and market dynamics with agility and tenacity. Finally, the Committee and Board strongly believe that the intent and integrity of the plan could not otherwise be maintained, and that this award has been earned by the team.\nOver the course of many months, the Committee continued to \nseek advice and guidance from our independent remuneration \nadvisors, PwC, on the relevant considerations and factors as well \nas the potential approaches and alternatives.

Remuneration strategy and framework\na) Remuneration strategy\nTWE\u2019s remuneration strategy sets the direction for the remuneration framework and drives the design and application of remuneration programs across the Company, including for executives. The strategy aims to attract, retain and reward the best talent while building a performance-oriented culture. It sets out principles and processes to ensure remuneration practices attract and motivate the highest calibre employees to achieve TWE\u2019s business and financial objectives.\nThe remuneration strategy is designed to achieve five key objectives.\n1.\n Attract, motivate and retain the highest calibre executives.\n \n2.\n Provide incentives and rewards that drive both our short and\n \nlong-term strategic objectives. \n3.\n Directly align the interests and outcomes of our executives with\n \nour shareholders.\n4.\n Create a performance-driven culture.\n5.\n Deliver results that reinforce our culture and are sustainable\n \nover the long-term. The Board believes that remuneration of executives should include a\u00a0fixed component and at-risk or performance-related components, including both short-term and long-term incentives. Executive and stakeholder interests are aligned through share ownership. The weighting of the at-risk remuneration components for each executive reflects the Board\u2019s commitment to performance-based reward. Section 3 of this report describes performance outcomes over the past five years, and how they have impacted remuneration outcomes.\nb) Remuneration framework\nAttract, motivate and \nretain the highest calibre executivesDrive both our short and long-term strategic objectivesAlign the interests and outcomes of our executives with our shareholdersCreate a performance-driven cultureDeliver results that reinforce our culture and are sustainable over the long-term\nComponents Performance measures DetailsRemuneration frameworkRemuneration strategy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "490a531e-1337-4156-bbe6-491187689688": {"__data__": {"id_": "490a531e-1337-4156-bbe6-491187689688", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "824ef09c-c24a-498f-9bf7-67237de1b076", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "88ff75e1d664fa8761d4ecd884899c71ff9523eaadf6fd9c2f9d2e13ce99294f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "64\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\nThe LTIP is designed to reward executives \nfor long-term performance and value creation for shareholders.\nIt is delivered in the form of Performance \nRights that vest at the end of the performance period if the performance and vesting conditions are met.

Performance and remuneration outcomes\na) Overview of Company performance\nCompany performance during F23 saw earnings and margin growth, driven by strong luxury top-line growth from Penfolds, successful price increases across several brands and cost savings from the global supply chain optimisation program. The premiumisation trends continue across the wine category with luxury wine continuing strong growth trends in all of TWE\u2019s key global markets.  Management executed strongly during the year and our diversified business model, together with the benefits of key asset base and cost optimisation initiatives, have resulted in a resilient premium wine category despite the tightening economic environment. \nTWE delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase on prior year and \nEBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points to 24.1%. We delivered EPS of 52.1 cents per share (before material items and SGARA) while ROCE increased from 10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued capital allocation discipline. The Company\u2019s capital structure remains flexible and efficient. We have retained a strong balance sheet and investment grade capital structure, with net  \ndebt/EBITDAS of 1.9x .\nDue to the outstanding performance from our executives and our\n \nglobal teams and execution of key strategic priorities, the Company \ndelivered strong operating momentum in F23. Penfolds reported a 14.2% increase in EBITS and NSR growth of 14.3% was delivered through Asia, Australia and EMEA, reflecting the continued momentum behind the Penfolds strategy to build distribution and grow consumer demand. Treasury Americas reported a 14.0% increase in EBITS and EBITS margin increased by 5.6 percentage points, led by strong performance of key luxury brands including Frank Family Vineyards and Beaulieu Vineyard and continued growth of premium brands, including Matua. This was partly offset by declines for 19 Crimes and Sterling Vineyards in addition to constrained luxury portfolio availability from the lower yielding 2020 Californian vintage. Treasury Premium Brands reported a 5.4% decline in EBITS while EBITS margin was in line with F22. Reduced NSR for the commercial portfolio in the UK and Australia were partly offset by 7.8% NSR growth for priority premium brands including 19 Crimes, Squealing Pig and Pepperjack. The combined premium and luxury portfolios delivered high  \ndouble-digit gross profit growth in F23. \nThe table below summarises the Company\u2019s financial performance\n \nover the last five financial years.\nTable 3.1: Overview of Company performance (reported)\nFinancial year ended 30 June 2023\nEBITS performance (A$ million) 664.7 512.6 510.3 523.7 583.5\nEarnings per share (cents)257.2 41.7 43.0 44.7 52.1\nDividends paid per share (cents) 35 40 23 28 343\nFranked (%) 100 100 100 100 100\nClosing share price ($ at 30 June) 14.92 10.48 11.68 11.35 11.23\nReturn on capital employed (%) 13.6 10.2 10.8 10.7 11.320191202012021 2022\n2023\n1.

In addition to its remuneration responsibilities and together with the Board, the  \nHRC\u2019s duties include overseeing talent management, inclusion, equity and diversity, culture, and leadership development.\nThe Committee ensures that the Company\u2019s policies and frameworks\n \naid the achievement of the Company\u2019s strategic objectives, provide \nappropriate governance, are aligned with market practice, and fulfil the Board\u2019s responsibility to shareholders. During the year the Audit and Risk Committee Chair attended all but one of the Human Resources Committee meetings as a Committee member. Also, the Human Resources Committee Chair typically attends the Audit and Risk Committee meetings, providing a link between both Committees to assist with oversight of non-financial risk.\nAs outlined in Section 4 of the Corporate Governance Statement \ndisclosed on the Company\u2019s website tweglobal.com, the Company has procedures in place for the reporting of any matter that may give rise to a conflict between the interests of a Director and those of the Company.  In addition, the Company has adopted a general policy for employees in relation to the disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest (see Section 4 of the Corporate Governance Statement on tweglobal.com).b)  Engagement of remuneration advisorsIn F23, the Board and HRC engaged PwC as an independent advisor to the HRC. Potential conflicts of interest are considered by the HRC, and the Board and HRC are satisfied that the advice provided by PwC was free from undue influence. Any advice provided by remuneration consultants is used as a guide only and is not a substitute for detailed consideration of all relevant issues by the HRC. No remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), were provided. \nc)  Executive and Non-Executive Director share ownership\nExecutives and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to have control over ordinary shares in the Company and executives and  \nNon-Executive Directors are required to hold at least the equivalent of one year\u2019s fixed remuneration or base fees. The guidelines are\n \nexpected to be met over a reasonable period of time (approximately five years).

A list of controlled entities (subsidiaries) is provided in note 28.\nAn entity is regarded as a controlled entity when the Company is \nexposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity.  \nThe rights of other investors to the results and equity of the subsidiaries (called non-controlling interests) are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and  \nother comprehensive income, consolidated statement of  \nchanges in equity and consolidated statement of financial  position respectively.\nThe financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the \nsame reporting period as the parent, using consistent accounting policies.  Intra-group balances and transactions arising from  \nintra-group transactions are eliminated.\n \nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of \ncontrol, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\nFunctional and presentation currency\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The major functional currencies used throughout the Group include Australian Dollar (AUD), United States Dollar (USD) and Great British Pound (GBP). Other currencies used include the Canadian Dollar, Euro, New Zealand Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Krona, Norwegian Krone and Chinese Renminbi.\nForeign group companies\nAs at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange \ndifference in equity for this operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as part of the gain and loss on sale.\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the relevant entity at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, except for gains or losses arising on assets or liabilities that qualify for hedge accounting, discussed further in note 26.            Tax charges and credits attributable to these exchange differences are also recognised in equity. \nAverage exchange rates used in translating profit and loss items in \nF23 are:A$1 = US$ 0.673 (F22: US$ 0.726)A$1 = GB\u00a3 0.559 (F22: GB\u00a3 0.545) \nYear-end exchange rates used in translating financial position \nitems in F23 are:A$1 = US$ 0.662 (F22: US$ 0.688)A$1 = GB\u00a3 0.525 (F22: GB\u00a3 0.568)\nFair value measurement \nThe Group measures certain financial instruments, including derivatives, and certain non-financial assets such as agricultural assets, at fair value at each balance sheet date.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in its principal or most advantageous market at the measurement date. It is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial item assumes it is put to its highest and best use.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in \nthe circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAccounting standards prescribe a fair value hierarchy, described \nas follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for \nidentical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input \nthat is significant to the fair value measurement is directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived by prices) observable.\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that \nis significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: About this report\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 1 - About this report (continued)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ebab8aa-776c-465c-91f3-9bd1c6aa272d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ebab8aa-776c-465c-91f3-9bd1c6aa272d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39608f0d-086b-456e-9f49-5d0a8a463a43", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "2af8a8eb79296e890cd69519882dbadc33f7d21c3f42918e952258d00d2bd731", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "86TREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nSegment accounting policies\nSegment assets and liabilities\nSegment assets and liabilities represent those working capital and non-current assets and liabilities which are located in the respective segments. Cash and borrowings, other than lease liabilities, are not considered to be segment assets/liabilities as they are managed by our centralised treasury function. Consistent with the use of EBITS for measuring profit, tax assets and liabilities, which do not contribute towards EBITS, are not allocated to operating segments.\nCorporate charges\nUnallocated corporate charges are reported in the Corporate/unallocated segment.  Net finance costs are not allocated to segments as the Group\u2019s financing function is centralised through its treasury function.\nSegment loans payable and loans receivable\nSegment loans are initially recognised at the amount transferred.  Intersegment loans receivable and payable that earn or incur non-market interest are adjusted to fair value based on market interest rates.  \nOtherIf items of revenue and expense are not allocated to operating segments, then any associated assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments either.The Group\u2019s segmentsThe Group reports segment information on the same basis as its internal management reporting structure and consistent with the information used to organise and manage the Group. \nDuring the current period, the business structure was reorganised \nto better reflect the Group\u2019s management of the Canadian operations, with a number of brands sold in Canada that are now managed by Treasury Premium Brands being remapped from Treasury Americas to Treasury Premium Brands. Comparatives have been restated to incorporate these changes. \nPresentation of segment results\nManagement EBITSThe principal profit metric for internal management reporting is Management earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS). Corporate charges are allocated to each segment on a proportionate basis linked to segment revenue, head count or other appropriate driver depending on the nature of the charge.\n \nSGARA represents the difference between the fair value of \nharvested grapes (as determined under AASB 141 \nAgriculture) \nand the cost of harvested grapes. The fair value gain or loss is excluded from Management EBITS so that earnings can be assessed based on the cost of harvest, rather than their fair value.  \nThis approach results in a better reflection of the true nature of TWE\u2019s consumer branded and FMCG business and improved comparability with domestic and global peers. The F23 SGARA loss of $64.5 million includes the impact of a significant reduction in tonnage and yield from the 2023 Australian vintage, resulting in losses of $24.7 million.  The Group has the following reportable segments:\n(i)\n Penfolds\n This segment is responsible for the manufacturing, sale and  \nmarketing of Penfolds wine globaly. \n(ii)\n Treasury Premium Brands\n This segment is responsible for the manufacturing, sale and  \nmarketing of wine within Australia, Asia, Europe, Middle-East \nand Africa.  \n(iii)  Treasury Americas\n This segment is responsible for the manufacture, sale  \nand marketing of wine within North American and Latin Americas regions.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: About this report\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 2 -

The Group\u2019s contracts with customers generally include one performance obligation. Revenue from the sale of products or services is recognised at the point in time when control over a product or service is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery. Revenue is recorded net of sales discounts and rebates, duties and taxes. Payment terms vary by customer. The following specific criteria are also applied:\nWine\nRevenue is recognised in a manner that depicts transfer of control of goods to customers at the amount that reflects the consideration the business expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Sales to national retail chains, domestic distributors, independent retailers and on-premise outlets are usually recognised when goods are delivered. Sales to international customers are recognised based on the international commercial terms the goods are shipped under, but typically when goods are despatched. This is also the case for some national retail chains that manage their own distribution networks.  \nBottling servicesRevenue is recognised when the relevant service has\n \nbeen\u00a0completed.\nTrade discounts and volume rebatesProducts are often sold with volume discounts and other rebates. Sales are recorded based on the consideration specified in the sales contracts or terms, net of the estimated discount or rebate at the time of sale. These discounts or rebates are considered variable consideration and are accounted for in determining the transaction price of a contract. The method used by the Group to estimate discounts and rebates is the most likely amount. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates based on anticipated purchases and depletions.Net sales revenue \u2013 types of productsThe Group generates revenue through the sale of branded wines, principally as a finished, bottled product. The Group\u2019s wine portfolio includes some of the world\u2019s leading Luxury, Premium and Commercial wine brands such as Penfolds, Beringer, Lindeman\u2019s, Wolf Blass, 19 Crimes, Beaulieu Vineyard, Sterling Vineyards and Stags\u2019 Leap.  \n \nThe Group distributes wine to a range of customers across the world, with routes to market tailored by country. Depending on the geography, wine is sold to distributors, wholesalers, direct to national retail chains, independent retailers and on-premise outlets. The Group also has some sales direct to the consumer.  \nOther revenue Other revenue of the Group includes contract bottling services to third parties, sub-lease income and grape and bulk wine sales.  \nSales approach For F23, the Group had no customers whose revenues represented more than 10% of reported net sales revenue. For F22, there was one customer in Treasury Americas whose revenues represented 11.4% of reported net sales revenue. \nFinancing components  \nThe Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised product or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Consequently, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Earnings\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3631, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87c964be-f643-42b2-aa21-29adf08cea24": {"__data__": {"id_": "87c964be-f643-42b2-aa21-29adf08cea24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7baf8067-68ef-4c52-8882-8339b7f1bea6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "62f72dd000e9d55c05f6194784955821ca9d483a357cc6df32319e5a56a27f6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "90\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Note 4 - Other earnings disclosures \n2023  \n$M2022  \n$M\nNet foreign exchange gains/(losses) 0.5 (0.6)\nSalaries and wages expense (386.5) (342.8)\nCosts associated with cloud computing arrangements (9.9) (7.2)\nShare based payments expense (13.8) (10.4)\nItems recognised as material items \u2013 refer note 5\nRestructuring and redundancy costs (82.6) (9.0)\n(Write-down)/reversal of write-down of assets (55.2) (3.2)\nNet profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment 34.4 (20.5)\nTransaction and integration costs (5.8) (12.8)\nOther itemsRestructuring and redundancy costs (0.3) (0.5)\nInsurance income 22.7 15.4\nNet profit on sale of property, plant and equipment 7.3 0.9\nTotal other gains and (losses) (79.5) (29.7)\nAccounting policies\nEmployee benefits\nEmployee benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave, bonuses, non-monetary benefits and share based payment expenses.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach for expected credit losses, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of receivables. Expected credit losses are calculated by utilising a provision matrix where loss rates are calculated based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (for example geography, product type and rating). The provision matrix is initially determined by the Group\u2019s historical observed loss rates and calibrated for forward looking information. Loss rates will be updated at each reporting date based on changes in observed default rates and changes in forward looking information. \nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of their cost (using weighted average or FIFO basis) or estimated net realisable value. \nThe cost of raw materials is their purchase price or, in the case \nof grapes sourced from Group owned vineyards, fair value (see note 12 for further details). The cost of manufactured goods is determined on a consistent basis and is made up of the raw materials and direct labour used in manufacture. It also includes other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\nNet realisable value represents the estimated selling price \nin the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables including accruals are recorded when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of purchases of goods or services. Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.Key estimates and judgements \nTrade discounts and volume rebatesKey estimates relate to the amount accrued for discounts and rebates. Products are often sold with trade discounts and volume rebates. Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts or terms, net of the estimated discount or rebate at the time of sale. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates based on anticipated purchases and depletions.\nNet realisable value of inventory\nThe period over which some wine inventories are converted from raw materials to finished goods can be a significant length of time. Failure to forecast demand effectively may result in excess inventories or missed revenue opportunities. \nForecast demand and market prices can vary significantly \nover the holding period up to the likely date of sale. Estimating the most likely conditions at the expected point of sale is therefore more challenging over the longer term. Non-current inventory is $1,175.3 million (F22: $1,063.6 million) and its estimated selling price is therefore a key estimate.

Non-lease components are distinct elements \nof a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased\n \nasset, such as inventory, common area maintenance, and other management costs. The Group has elected to measure the amount disclosed in relation to variable leases for these arrangements by combining the lease and non-lease components.\n \nCertain leases include variable lease payments, including payments \nthat depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for\n \nitems such as grapes, labour, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes that will vary depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard.\nSuch variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of \nthe right-of-use asset and are recognised in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nAccounting policies\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in AASB 16 Leases.\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability \nat the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the \nstraight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of \nthe lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. \nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by \nobtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease \nliability comprise the following:\n\u2022\n fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n\u2022\n variable lease payments that depend on an index or\na rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the \ncommencement date; \u2022 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value\nguarantee; and\n\u2022\n the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is\nreasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a \ncorresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets as \u2018right-of-use \nassets\u2019 and lease liabilities in \u2018borrowings\u2019 in the consolidated statement

Internally generated brand names are not capitalised and expenditure incurred in developing, maintaining or enhancing brand names is charged to profit or loss in the year incurred.  \nBrand names are initially recognised at cost when purchased individually and at fair value when acquired with a business.  This fair value is determined by reference to independent valuations.  \nFollowing initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.  \nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents the difference between the purchase price and share of the net assets of the acquired business, recorded at fair value.   \nFollowing initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually (see note 15).IT development and softwareOther than in relation to Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) arrangement, costs incurred in developing information technology (IT) products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and multi-year licenses are capitalised as intangible IT assets. They include the cost of purchased software and internal labour and contractors used in the development of software.  \nIT assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their expected useful life (2 -10 years) on a straight-line basis. Amortisation is included in \u2018Other expenses\u2019 in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  \nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider\u2019s application software over the contract period.

Recoverable amount is the higher of the asset\u2019s (or CGU\u2019s) fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.  Accounting policiesFair value is determined in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 1.\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are \ndiscounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\nReversals of impairment \nIf there is an indicator that a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, recoverable amount is estimated. If there has been a change in the estimates used to determine an asset\u2019s recoverable amount since an impairment loss was recognised, the carrying value of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount (limited to the amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years). \nAny reversal is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit \nor loss and other comprehensive income with an adjustment to depreciation in future periods to allocate the asset\u2019s revised carrying value, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

Key estimates and judgements include:\nCash flow forecasts\nCash flow forecasts are based on the Group\u2019s most recent five-year financial plans approved by the Board. Key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts include sales volume growth, cost of sales and cost of doing business. \nThe Group\u2019s assumptions regarding sales volume growth \nand costs of doing business are based on expectations of the market demand and past experience. The assumption on cost of sales is based on expectation about future vintage costs which assume continuity of sourcing and access to fruit. \nThese estimates, judgements and assumptions are based on \nforecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions as at 30 June 2023 about future events that the Directors believe are reasonable in the circumstances.  \nLong-term growth rates\nCash flow forecasts beyond a five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate range of 2.0% to 3.0% (F22: 2.0% to 3.0%). Growth rates are specific to individual CGUs and reflect expected future market and economic conditions.  \nDiscount ratesThe Group applies a post-tax discount rate to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method closely approximates applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. The post-tax discount rates incorporate a risk-adjustment relative to the risks associated with the net post-tax cash flows being achieved.

A reduction in cash flow forecasts of more than 26% for all years in the forecast period and also in the terminal year would reduce the CGU\u2019s headroom to nil.

They are recognised only when it is probable the liability will arise and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.  \nIf the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate plus, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n \nEmployee entitlements\nLiabilities for employees\u2019 entitlements to wages and salaries, annual leave and other current employee entitlements (that are expected to be paid within 12 months) are measured at amounts expected to be paid as at the reporting date.\nLiabilities for other employee entitlements, which are not \nexpected to be paid or settled within 12 months of reporting date, are accrued in respect of all employees at the present value of future amounts expected to be paid.RestructuringRestructuring provisions are recognised at the point when a detailed plan for the restructure has been developed and implementation has commenced. The cost of restructuring provided is the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the appropriate rate which reflects the risks of the cash flow.\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is \nterminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of a current employee according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or upon the provision of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy.\nSupply contracts\nSupply contracts provisions are measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract (discounted to present value if material).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3025, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01fdc9e7-4394-4d43-98ef-d87fd3f5f4f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "01fdc9e7-4394-4d43-98ef-d87fd3f5f4f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f434fdd3-07ea-4191-bc51-d28f333e0868", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a5ce69d94f55882fa2a383414aeb968547a4319492d349dfbf518f17ec1d355a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "106\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Note 17 - Capital management\nNote 18 - Borrowings The Group considers capital to be the combination of shareholders\u2019 \nequity, reserves and net debt.

Restricted equity awards require continued employment with the Group through the restriction period.  \nOther terms are similar to the STIP terms above.  \nRestricted equity awards may be granted to compensate employees for foregoing equity compensation in their previous organisation as a sign-on award and/or as a retention incentive.\nShare Cellar (broad-based Employee Share Plan)\nShare Cellar is the Group\u2019s broad-based Employee Share Plan and plan participation is offered annually. The plan was first launched early in 2015. Participation is voluntary and employees in select countries are eligible to join the Plan. Share Cellar operates as a matching plan whereby employees contribute funds to the Plan from their after-tax pay and shares are acquired by the Group on their behalf. For employees enrolling in the 2021-2023 plans, the Group will deliver one matched share for every purchased share held at the plan vesting date, subject to continued employment.\n \nParticipants are entitled to dividends and to exercise voting rights \nattached to the shares purchased under the plan, and matched shares once they have been allocated.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Capital structure\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3262, "end_char_idx": 5333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7071aba-bf2f-4188-9066-585e5b6fcee9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7071aba-bf2f-4188-9066-585e5b6fcee9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b6cface-4817-422f-b8c4-aa7f01091016", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "5192ca639cc4b282610735954bc887cfbac9af3d341a697acf1586466aee9055", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "110\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Active share-based payment plans:\nLong-term Incentive Plans\nThe below table outlines the F23 and F22 LTIP plans which have a vesting date post 30 June 2023:\nThe below table outlines the F23 GLG LTIP plan which has a vesting date post 30 June 2023:Grant dateF23 Plan\n1-Nov-22 F22 Plan\n1-Dec-21  \nGrant date share price $13.03 $11.79\nExpected share price volatility (%) 40.0 42.0\nExpected dividend yield (%) 2.6 2.7\nRisk-free interest rate (%) 3.36 0.77\nFair value estimate at grant date - TSR $9.12 $7.39\nFair value estimate at grant date - ROCE $12.16 $11.00\nFair value estimate at grant date - EPS $12.16 -\nGrant dateF23 Plan\n1-Oct-22 \nGrant date share price $12.57\nExpected dividend yield (%) 2.6\nFair value estimate at grant date \u2013 EBITS & EBITS Margin $11.70\nFair value estimate time-based \u2013 Vesting F23: 2025 $11.65Note 22 - Employee equity plans (continued)\nAccounting policies\nEmployee equity plans are accounted for as share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for the awards. \nThe fair value of the shares and performance rights that are expected to vest is progressively recognised as an employee benefits expense over the relevant vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.\nThe fair value of shares granted is determined by reference to observed market values.

The Group fully cooperates with these enquiries as and when they arise.\nOECD global minimum tax framework\nThe Group operates in two countries (Japan and the United Kingdom) which have either enacted or substantively enacted new tax legislation to implement the Pillar Two global minimum top-up tax (top-up tax). The Group does not expect to be subject to material top-up tax in relation to its operations in any of these countries as the effective tax rate is expected to be greater than 15%. The newly enacted tax legislation in these countries is effective only from years commencing from 1 January 2024. \nThe Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred \ntax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and will account for it as a current tax if it is incurred from 1 July 2024 (see Note 33).  Key estimate and judgement\nTaxationThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting policies\nCurrent taxesCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, taxation authorities at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred taxes\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent it is probable that they will be utilised.\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at \neach reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it will become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed \nat balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise them.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the \ntax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at balance sheet date between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than for:\n\u2022\n The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction\n \nthat is not a business combination and at the time of \nthe transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or on the recognition of goodwill.\n\u2022\n Foreign taxes which may arise in the event of retained\n \nprofits of foreign controlled entities being remitted to Australia as there is no present intention to make any such remittances.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities associated with \nindefinite life intangibles such as brand names are measured based on the tax consequences that would follow from the use and sale of that asset. \nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are \nrecognised in equity and not in profit or loss.\nOffsetting deferred tax balances\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.Note 24 -Income tax (continued)Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Taxation\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30a68dca-2403-496d-83c5-f419af25bdf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "30a68dca-2403-496d-83c5-f419af25bdf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "190c5ce9-af8f-455b-aaee-af2d0c03665f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "723bdddc90eb5057d58594aeb75b1aa88098ae6971a32ec43d44112b35ec9b3c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "115\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNote 25 - Financial risk management \nFinancial risk management framework \nThe Group\u2019s financial risk management policies (\u2018Group Treasury Policies\u2019) cover risk tolerance, internal controls (including segregation of duties), delegated authority levels, management of foreign currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposures, and the reporting of exposures.

Where available, credit opinions on counterparties from two credit rating agencies are used to determine credit limits.\nThe Group assesses the credit quality of individual customers prior \nto offering credit terms and continues to monitor on a regular basis. Each customer is assigned a risk profile based upon the measurable risk indicators for dishonoured payments, adverse information and average days late along with the securities and guarantees held. All prospective accounts are required to complete a credit application and generally a director\u2019s guarantee is required with minimal exceptions. Failure to provide a director\u2019s guarantee results in either no credit or a limited level of credit offered. Credit terms may be reduced or extended for individual customers based on risk.\nIn F23 the Group, as part of its normal monitoring of the credit quality \nof trade receivables, continued frequent telephone contact and engagement with customers to understand customer trading and credit circumstances, and supporting them through any short-term challenges identified. The Group also continued to monitor customer credit risk assessments across the entire customer portfolio. \nPast due accounts are subject to a number of collection activities \nwhich range from telephone contact, suspension of orders through to legal action. Past due accounts are reviewed monthly with specific focus on accounts that are greater than 90 days overdue.  \nWhere debt cannot be recovered, it is escalated from the credit representative to the credit manager to initiate recovery action.\nFor derivatives, the Group transacts under an International Swaps\n \nand Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement. If a \ncredit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under an ISDA agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. \n \nLevel of exposure at balance date\nThe maximum counterparty credit risk exposure at 30 June 2023 in\n \nrespect of derivative financial instruments was $23.3 million (F22: $22.0 million) and in respect of cash and cash equivalents was $113.9 million (F22: $186.2 million). The Group\u2019s authorised counterparties are restricted to banks and financial institutions whose long-term credit rating is at or above a Standard and Poors rating of A- (or Moody\u2019s equivalent rating of A3), with any exceptions requiring approval from the Board.

There is no collateral held as security against the receivables above and there are no other receivables past due. \nNote 26 - Derivative financial instruments\nAt reporting date, there were $556.9 million (Australian dollar equivalent) net face value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts at contract rates (F22: $385.4 million), interest rate swaps of $1,021.1 million (F22: $857.2 million) and cross currency interest rate swaps of $181.3 million (F22: $174.4 million) and interest rate collars of nil (F22: $203.4 million). These instruments are regarded as Level 2 under AASB\u2019s Fair Value measurement hierarchy.\nNote 27 - Fair values\nThe fair value of the US Private Placement Notes is $904.8 million (F22: $484.1 million) and the fair value of the syndicated debt facility is $552.7 million (F22: $644.3 million). The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and other financial liabilities approximate their carrying value. There have been no reclassifications of financial assets from fair value to cost, or from cost or amortised cost to fair value during the year.\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments are based upon \nmarket prices, or models using inputs observed from the market, where markets exist or have been determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by the current interest rate for financial assets and financial liabilities with similar risk profiles (a Level 2 valuation).\nThe valuation of derivative financial assets and liabilities reflects \nthe estimated amounts which the Group would be required to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (net of transaction costs) or replace the contracts at their current market rates at reporting date.  This is based on internal valuations using standard valuation techniques. \nAs the purpose of these derivative financial instruments is to hedge \nthe Group\u2019s underlying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge against risk of interest rate fluctuations, it is unlikely in the absence of abnormal circumstances that these contracts would be terminated prior to maturity.For all other recognised financial assets and financial liabilities, based on the facts and circumstances existing at reporting date and the nature of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities including hedge positions, the Group has no reason to believe that the financial assets could not be exchanged, or the financial liabilities could not be settled, in an arm\u2019s length transaction at an amount approximating its carrying amount.(d)  Credit risk (continued)The ageing of the consolidated Group trade receivables (net of provisions) is outlined below:\n2023\n$M2022\n$M\nNot past due 378.5 387.7\nPast due 1-30 days 50.9 25.4\nPast due 31-60 days 5.6 4.3\nPast due 61 days+ 5.9 2.5\nTotal 440.9 419.9Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Risk\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 25 - Financial risk management (continued)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6df598b1-f397-47d3-a319-a03f9c3013b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6df598b1-f397-47d3-a319-a03f9c3013b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3bfe14f2-80e8-4538-ad7f-1066aa5bb297", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "2e8807c9d06c0111114860cdf99f0e7b6f11bc79c28a2ada7533ffec8215afa1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "122\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the following subsidiaries:Note 28 - Subsidiaries\nEntity name Country of incorporation \nEquity holding of 100% (F21: 100%)\nAldershot Nominees Pty.

This is determined on initial recognition. \nFinancial assets classified as at amortised cost are measured \ninitially at fair value and adjusted in respect of any incremental and directly attributable transaction costs. All other financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition. \nReclassification occurs only if there are fundamental changes \nto the Group\u2019s business model for managing financial assets.\nAmortised cost  \nA financial asset is classified as at amortised cost only if \nthe asset is held to collect contractual cash flows and the\n \ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost using the \neffective interest rate method. Any gains and losses are recognised through the amortisation process or when the financial asset is derecognised or impaired.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are determined using historical recovery of contractual cash flows and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for current economic and credit conditions. An impairment loss is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss when they are expected, not when they are incurred. If a later event causes the impairment loss to decrease, the amount is reversed in profit or loss. \nDerecognition of financial assets  \nThe derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the \nGroup no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise\n \nthe financial instrument. \nThis is normally the case when the instrument is sold or all the \ncash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party. Other accounting policiesDerivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps and options to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and are financial assets when the fair value is positive and financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any \ngains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year. \nHedge accounting\nFor the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction; or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\nInitial recognition\nAt the beginning of a hedge relationship, the Group designates and documents the hedge relationship and the related risk management objective and strategy.  The documentation identifies the hedging instrument and the hedged item as well as describing the economic relationship, the hedge ratio between them and potential sources of ineffectiveness. The documentation also includes the nature of the risk being hedged and the method of assessing the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness.  To achieve hedge accounting, the relationship must be expected to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they continue to meet the risk management objective.\nRe-balancing\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer met but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group will rebalance the relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedged item or the volume of the hedging instrument.\nDiscontinuation\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5355, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8933e7d-f7e4-402c-8e5c-074b7fdb4675": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8933e7d-f7e4-402c-8e5c-074b7fdb4675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31ad8cee-0876-4aa6-b63f-f3102ec77703", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "87deac0dc0874955957940816c1c4fca89ef919611d9ae6849ab28d66d9f3d47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fded07b5-9447-4547-86ed-d5c73e6e742f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/gen-app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "dd21c199a41624999a8802b74160ba18f415a4058c5855fe616d7cdecf1afb17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To achieve hedge accounting, the relationship must be expected to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they continue to meet the risk management objective.\nRe-balancing\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer met but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group will rebalance the relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedged item or the volume of the hedging instrument.\nDiscontinuation\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

The second action was served on 1 May 2020 by Maurice Blackburn (MB) acting for Steven Napier. The class in both proceedings comprise shareholders who purchased shares between 30 June 2018 and 28 January 2020. The two actions were consolidated into a single action on 15 October 2020. TWE filed its Defence on 25 February 2021. On 21 April 2023, the joint plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Statement of Claim (ASOC). The proceedings allege that the Company breached its continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX Listing Rules and the Corporations Act and that it engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act.   Regarding the claims, the Company strongly denies any and all allegations made against it and is vigorously defending the proceedings.
