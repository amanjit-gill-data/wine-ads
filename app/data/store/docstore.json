PENFOLDS WINES\nOther highlights?\n2021 is the key vintage for this year\u2019s releases. It was a wonderful vintage\nthroughout South Australia (and other parts of the country, but Penfolds\nwines are mostly SA). Yields were reduced but the quality is described vari\u2010\nously in Penfolds\u2019 booklet of wine notes as \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018brilliant\u2019 and\n\u2018outstanding\u2019.\nBin 169 Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 was my highest scoring\nwine with 98 points, and at AUD $300 it seems relatively good value.\nClose behind it on 97 points were the 2019 Grange, 2021 RWT Shiraz,\n2021 Yattarna Chardonnay, the 2020 Bin 149 Napa Valley/South Australia\nCabernet Sauvignon, and 2019 Quantum Bin 98 Cabernet Sauvignon, a\nNapa Valley / South Australia blend. This last wine is a running-mate for\nGrange as both are priced at AUD $1,000 a bottle (Grange\u2019s price is un\u2010\nchanged from last year\u2019s).\nOn 96 points were 2021 Bin 707 Cabernet Sauvignon, 2021 Magill Estate\nShiraz and 2022 Reserve Bin A Chardonnay.\nSpecial mention goes to one of the cheaper wines of the Collection:\nPenfolds Bin 128 Coonawarra Shiraz (AUD $65 and 95 points). This is a\nstunning Bin 128: packed with flavour, its multi-faceted fragrance positively\nleaps from the glass.\nOf the international wines which are now an integral part of the Collection,\nwe see two French wines (2020 Bin FWT 585, a Bordeaux cabernet merlot\npetit verdot) and Penfolds x Dourthe II Cabernet Shiraz Merlot, a multi-vin\u2010\ntage (2020-21) blend of South Australia and Bordeaux grapes.04/10/2024, 01:50 A Penfolds Collection of splendour \u2013 The Real Review\nhttps://www.therealreview.com/2023/07/20/a-penfolds-collection-of-splendour/ 4/18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1684, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52174158-e5ed-4a28-b541-b42482f36dad": {"__data__": {"id_": "52174158-e5ed-4a28-b541-b42482f36dad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "A Penfolds Collection of splendour \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/A Penfolds Collection of splendour \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 651657, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86e187d9-c1ec-4ead-a398-9363e280fea1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "A Penfolds Collection of splendour \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/A Penfolds Collection of splendour \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 651657, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "a80c7a60cf90aaa50757ee32dcffaf01d8b042b308fed6391e42d1d4f6659c32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Bin 169 Coonawarra\nCabernet Sauvignon 2021\nwas my highest scoring\nwine with 98 points, and at\nAUD $300 it seems relat\u2010\nively good value.We also see five wines resulting from the\nCalifornian venture. Three are Californian reds,\ntwo are South Australia/Napa Valley blends.\nHigh-priced wines which it\u2019s impossible to fault.\nNo doubt critics will be higher on some and\nlower on others, but quality-wise it\u2019s really just\na cigarette paper between them.\nOne of the Californians, Bin 600, is a cabernet\nshiraz blended from Paso Robles shiraz and Napa Valley cabernet. At AUD\n$90 it\u2019s the cheapest of the international wines, but heavens it\u2019s good, and is\nan interesting new take on the classic Aussie cab-shiraz blend. This time the\nshiraz comes from California\u2019s best shiraz region, the cabernet from its best\ncabernet region. We can perceive the cassis and blackberry of the cabernet\nand the smoky/graphite of the shiraz, much as you might in an Aussie cab-\nshiraz.

National holidays such as Republic Day (26 January), Independence Day (15\nAugust) and Gandhi Jayanti  (2 October) are usually dry days throughout India.[8] Dry days also depend\non the establishment selling alcohol.

Chardonnay is a suave charmer, layered in smooth textures and warm flavors kissed\nwith oak, with comfort as its calling card. Sauvignon Blanc is a brisk refresher, zesty in acidity, crisp on the tongue and\nbright in grassy, tropical flavors that enliven the palate.\nOn the other hand, these two contenders are remarkably similar.\nBoth emerged from somewhat mysterious origins in France, where they rose to recognition as noble grape varieties. They\nthen traveled the world to almost every wine region, where they\u2019re able to reflect microclimates like few other varieties.\nAnd they\u2019re simultaneously shapeshifters, both Sauv Blanc and Chard willfully bending toward whatever style a winemaker\ndesires, from the sharp edges enabled by stainless tanks to the round curves cultivated by oak aging.\nSame, Same But Different\nThanks to such similarities, the arguments levied when vintners are challenged to elevate one over the other tend to echo a\nbit.\n\u201cNo other grape variety makes as diverse a set of styles of wines as Chardonnay, and no other variety can be planted in\nsuch a diverse set of regions and climates as Chardonnay and still make good wine,\u201d asserts Richie Allen, who\u2019s been\ncrafting Chardonnay (plus a good amount of Sauvignon Blanc) for Rombauer Vineyards for more than 25 years. \u201cYou can\nplant it anywhere in almost any soil type and it always makes a wine that is relatively palatable. No other variety can do\nthat.\u201d\nOr, you can instead trust Kathy Joseph, who founded Fiddlehead Cellars in Santa Barbara County as a Sauv Blanc and Pinot\nbrand back in 1988. \u201cSauvignon Blanc to me is more terroir-driven than Chardonnay,\u201d says Joseph, who has long been\ndisappointed by the many generic Chards on the market. \u201cSauvignon Blanc has more variety of character, depending on\nwhere it\u2019s planted, how it\u2019s farmed and what you do with it in the cellar. You can pick different Sauvignon Blancs for\ndifferent moments in your life\u2014what you\u2019re eating, what the weather is like, what part of the world you\u2019re in.\u201d\nJoseph\u2019s career inspired the path of John Dragonette and Brandon Sparks-Gillis of Dragonette Cellars, who similarly\nappreciate Sauvignon Blanc for its variability. \u201cIf you want, and you have the right terroir, you can make a Sauv Blanc like\nWill Ferrell\u2014light, fun, airy\u2014or make one like Robert DeNiro: deep, deadly, serious,\u201d says Dragonette.04/10/2024, 01:53 How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time | Wine Enthusiast Magazine\nhttps://www.wineenthusiast.com/basics/wine-pairing-indian-food/ 7/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2688, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c86176d-ccf3-45e5-a6c5-64ac3c5043cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c86176d-ccf3-45e5-a6c5-64ac3c5043cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 24457289, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff6f5453-afdc-41bd-aec2-92732b2301cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 24457289, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "527b3427a027c62c44ddedfd66a5a5c14110087cff8c83db582c3dafb02841cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Like many wineries in California, the Dragonette lineup includes both Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay, so the men are\nhard-pressed to choose one over the other. \u201cIt would be a split decision,\u201d says Dragonette.\nPopularity, Backlash and Evolving Palates\nBut Chardonnay tends to earn more critical praise and commercial status than Sauvignon Blanc, explains Sparks-Gillis, and\nthat may indicate that there\u2019s something more to the variety.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re splitting hairs, Chardonnay just has this kaleidoscopic ability to be complex and really complete,\u201d he says.\n\u201cChardonnay can be enjoyed early and then gains complexity as it ages. It\u2019s rare to find Sauvignon Blancs that can\ntranscend the more everyday style.\u201d\nWhereas Chardonnay has enjoyed an endless quest of refinement over the decades, most modern Sauvignon Blanc tends\nto be made quickly in stainless steel tanks. \u201cYou can lose that ultimate completeness of the wine and the concentration,\u201d\nsays Sparks-Gillis.\nBoth grapes faced uphill battles at different stages of their New World rise. Chardonnay was a victim of its own success, as\nthe buttery styles of the 1990s and early 2000s triggered the \u201cAnything But Chardonnay\u201d movement. That resistance still\nsimmers today, despite the fact that buttery Chardonnays are far less common than they once were.\nFor Sauvignon Blanc, the challenge was right at the start. \u201cIt was virtually given no recognition,\u201d says Joseph of how the\nnow popular varietal was seen when she started out in 1981, when the wines tended to be flat and sweet. That\u2019s when the\nbrilliant vintner Robert Mondavi recast the grapes as serious and dry, naming his versions \u201cFum\u00e9 Blanc.\u201d\n\u201cThe consumer took a huge liking to this new wine,\u201d recalls Joseph. \u201cSauvignon Blanc suddenly had the opportunity to gain\nmuch better definition by considering where the fruit was planted and how it was farmed. I felt like I could be a part of\nthat.\u201d\nHer Fiddlehead brand evolved to produce three distinct styles, from fresh and tropical to barrel-aged and rich.\nMinimal Intervention, Major Change\nThe New World\u2019s exploration of Sauv Blanc styles is decades behind Chardonnay\u2019s learning curve. But there are exciting\ndevelopments on the horizon, according to Erica Crawford, who co-founded the revolutionary New Zealand Sauvignon\nBlanc brand Kim Crawford. Since selling that brand two decades ago, \u201cI couldn\u2019t put Sauvignon to my lips for four years,\u201d\nshe says with a laugh.\nThen, in 2013, she and her husband, Kim, created the organic-minded label Loveblock Wine, where they\u2019re expanding the\npossibilities of the country\u2019s infamous Sauv Blanc.\n\u201cSome people are finding that the classic Marlborough style is a little big and in their face,\u201d says Crawford, who helped\nmake such flavors famous. \u201cWe\u2019re exploring and evolving the style.\u201d\nTheir latest project is using green tea tannin instead of sulfur as a preservative, which is revealing new Sauvignon Blanc\ncharacteristics like mandarin, saffron and cumin alongside the grape\u2019s typical jalapeno note.\n\u201cWe see more and more flavors opening up as we are intervening less and less,\u201d she says. \u201cSulfur is like a little blanket that\ngets put over the flavors and the acid at the same time. It\u2019s really quite interesting in this controlled situation to see the\ndifference between the two.\u201d04/10/2024, 01:53 How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time | Wine Enthusiast Magazine\nhttps://www.wineenthusiast.com/basics/wine-pairing-indian-food/ 8/12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3457, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7b8003c-f0fe-461c-a176-93285b9816dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7b8003c-f0fe-461c-a176-93285b9816dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 24457289, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d0cedb6-8436-4aec-84c9-1b37d0e3948d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/How to Pair Wine with Indian Food and Succeed Every Time _ Wine Enthusiast Magazine.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 24457289, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "6aba12b47704bb9f373f1e05a88e427d09478f22b0cd1c4540ccb183c405c83b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So, What\u2019s the Verdict?\nPerhaps that final bell is yet to ring in this battle.\nChardonnay definitely has the edge when it comes to popularity. \u201cUnfortunately, more customers are familiar with\nChardonnay, so I\u2019m on a constant teaching program to open the door for people to consider the different styles of\nSauvignon Blanc,\u201d says Joseph. \u201cBut I love encouraging people to give it another try, to explore the possibilities out there,\nbecause there are so many.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s at least one benefit that all wine lovers can appreciate when it comes to Sauv Blanc. \u201cSauvignon Blanc is one of\nmy favorite wines to teach young winemakers how to make,\u201d says Allen from Rombauer. \u201cIt\u2019s about precision in how you\nprotect the aromatics.

Whilst it would be na\u00efve, therefore, to ignore this context or overtly challenge this ethos, India has evolved into a hugely promising market for beverage alcohol brand owners, with yet more enormous growth potential \u2013 but in such a complex, regulated and sometimes challenging country, detailed local knowledge is key.\n\nRecent consumption growth in India has been both dynamic and broad-based: in 2022, spirits volumes climbed by 12%, beer rose by 38%, RTDs were up 40% and wine increased by 19%, according to IWSR figures; and, in all cases, value rose ahead of volume.\n\n\u201cThe volume growth seen in India in 2022 was still in the nature of a recovery following the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in beer,\u201d explains Emily Neill, COO Research, IWSR. \u201cAll categories are offering strong double-digit growth in the context of a global market only registering single-digit advances.\u201d\n\nIWSR category forecasts also point to a positive outlook for all major categories in India in the years ahead: while global TBA (total beverage alcohol) volumes are expected to rise at a CAGR of only +1% between 2022 and 2027, the forecast figure for India\u2019s spirits volumes is +4%, with beer at +3%, RTDs at +10% and wine at +7%. Value trends are forecast to follow a similar trajectory.\n\nFavourable demographics and a knowledgeable consumer base\n\nDemographic factors underpin this growth: India\u2019s drinking age population is relatively young and increasingly affluent. The country\u2019s median age was 25.7 in 2012, versus 35.2 in China and 37.0 in the US, and will be 37.2 in 2050 (with China at 48.7 and the US at 40.0). Each year another 15 to 20 million citizens reach LDA age (source: UN World Population Prospects).\n\nBy 2050, India\u2019s working age population is predicted to top 1.1bn (versus 790m in China and 255m in the US) (source: UN World Population Prospects). Between 2021 and 2031, it\u2019s estimated that another 283m people will join India\u2019s middle classes (source: ICE360 household survey).\n\nGenerational attitudes show a greater interest in alcohol among younger LDA Indians, according to IWSR consumer research. While older (40+) drinkers are moderating their consumption, millennials are over-indexing significantly on nine out of the top 10 drinks categories, including beer, wine, Champagne, and a number of spirits segments.\n\nBeyond demographic factors, the intrinsic nature of the country\u2019s beverage alcohol market is also advantageous. \u201cOne of the key attributes of the Indian market is that demand is configured in a western way,\u201d explains Jason Holway, IWSR Senior Market Analyst. \u201cIf you compare it to, say, China, where baijiu dominates spirits volumes, Indian consumers already drink whisky, brandy, rum, vodka and gin.\n\n\u201cSo, on a purely practical level, if you\u2019re looking to encourage more or better consumption, domestic demand for these products already exists \u2013 the biggest volumes in each spirits categories are for Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL). In many other emerging markets, you first have to convert consumers to your product before you can take them up to premium, higher-priced brands.\n\n\u201cThe main function of an international brand in this context is to be aspirational \u2013 but, in India, you don\u2019t have to tell people as much about how or when to use your product. They already know that.\u201d\n\nAgain, the quality of local products is improving all the time, meaning that Indian whiskies and gins, for example, are credibly moving up the price ladder and becoming increasingly aspirational to local consumers, increasing competition.\n\nIWSR consumer research also reveals a heightened interest in moderation. \u201cIndia will almost certainly be a key market in any reconfiguration of TBA globally to no/low-alcohol\u201d says Luke Tegner, Consulting Director \u2013 Rest of World, IWSR. \u201cBut, in an extremely price-sensitive market, pricing itself will be a challenge.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8f418c96-5d32-4555-b514-8d98c0cc71f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8f418c96-5d32-4555-b514-8d98c0cc71f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_name": "IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7174, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08f0121c-3789-4f93-a331-6436f61306f5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_name": "IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7174, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "b4b367d5a970fe368d616a405fd19c5b1cc579f0751f46fc014969e987a8b0d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cfbe5674-578b-4f24-bc3e-469df3e2d87f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_name": "IWSR - how do you tackle the Indian beverage alcohol market.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 7174, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "eba16e201b7a59a1a2df72b2d78887ea28fc1ee239b6101df5ba3b8000c2a09c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In many other emerging markets, you first have to convert consumers to your product before you can take them up to premium, higher-priced brands.\n\n\u201cThe main function of an international brand in this context is to be aspirational \u2013 but, in India, you don\u2019t have to tell people as much about how or when to use your product.

Whilst lowered excise rates should permit no/low products to be attractively priced against their alcohol inclusive equivalents, they are likely to remain much more expensive than many soft drinks.\u201d\n\nA fragmented and complex market landscape\n\nWhile the scale of the opportunity in India is clear enough, so too are the challenges and barriers to growth \u2013 above and beyond the obvious issues of high import and excise tariffs.\n\nIndia\u2019s beverage alcohol market is very fragmented and extremely complex, Tegner cautions. \u201cThe levels of bureaucracy are phenomenal and, whatever you do, you have to do on a state-by-state basis,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t do things nationwide, so you really need a well-connected, knowledgeable importer and distributor. You certainly don\u2019t want to try to do it all yourself.\u201d\n\nLogistics need to be planned at a local level; it\u2019s easy to lose sight of the sheer size of some of Indian states. The size of Maharashtra\u2019s population, for example, is equivalent to that of Japan, while Karnataka\u2019s rivals that of the UK.\n\nLocal challenges, meanwhile, include labelling \u2013 which will often specify that a product can only be sold in a certain state \u2013 and maximum retail pricing, which can destroy margins, especially at a time of rising costs.\n\nThe conformation of the market also complicates the establishment of a viable ecommerce channel in India \u2013 something which would seem to be an obvious benefit, given the widespread use of mobile technology and the cheapness of data.\n\nIn a country where the legal drinking age varies from 18 to 25, having chain of custody proof of age technology is likely to require \u201cmassive investment which may do little more than just increase unit costs\u201d, warns Holway. He also points out that the consumer need is already being met via informal \u2018quick commerce\u2019, where a purchaser simply calls a liquor store and arranges local delivery for cash.\n\nHowever, the fragmentation of India\u2019s beverage alcohol landscape could also prove beneficial to market newcomers, who can start small and expand their market presence progressively.\n\n\u201cThe advantage here is that you don\u2019t have to be nationwide and launch everywhere straightaway,\u201d says Holway, who advises prioritising key regions/cities, such as Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi/NCR, Karnataka, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and/or Goa.\n\n\u201cSome of these regions are cheaper and easier to become involved in,\u201d Holway adds. \u201cAnd one of the reasons why it\u2019s good to be in these places is the recent improvement in the quality of retail, with high-class, duty free-style stores popping up in big metropolitan areas such as Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai. These have mainly been in Tier 1 cities to date but establishment in Tier 2 cities is already on the horizon.\n\n\u201cSo, however you approach the Indian market, you must be selective and build slowly \u2013 you don\u2019t need to have a presence everywhere from the very beginning.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3234, "end_char_idx": 7051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35cf3e96-380f-4bb0-a316-f43063eba812": {"__data__": {"id_": "35cf3e96-380f-4bb0-a316-f43063eba812", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 161312, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ddcc9606-1eaf-48d4-bc5c-64a419612e38", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 161312, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "0919d67bbace691f8f18ddec1557fae84dc4908015375ad015dc8ecc17fd738e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Press Release  June 2021 \n \n IWSR Data Shows US Total Beverage Alcohol Consumption in 2020 was the Largest Volume Gain in Nearly 20 Years Driven by Consumer Demand for Flavor, Convenience, and Better-For-You Options, Key Beverage Alcohol Segments were Accelerated by the Increase in At-Home Occasions in 2020  New York \u2013 Total beverage alcohol volume in the US last year was up +2.0%, marking the largest gain for alcohol consumption in the country since 2002, according to new findings from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the leading authority on the global beverage alcohol market.  IWSR research shows that year-to-date 2021 performance in the US is still higher than 2019, with the year expected to end at +3.8% growth in volume and +5.5% increase in value. IWSR forecasts a more moderate growth rate over the next five years as normalization returns, with a +0.5% volume and +2.8% value CAGR 2020-2025.  \u201cA key driver of US beverage alcohol consumption is flavor,\u201d says Brand Rand, IWSR\u2019s COO of the Americas. \u201cFlavored subcategories \u2013 from beer to vodka to US whiskey \u2013 are significantly outperforming traditional non-flavored sub-categories. Flavor is also the top consumer driver of the fast-growing ready-to-drink (RTD) category, and that\u2019s likely creating a halo effect on total alcohol as well.\u201d  IWSR\u2019s analysis of the US beverage alcohol market by category:  Spirits market in the US posts largest volume increase since 1990 The US market posted the largest volume increase (+4.6%) for the spirits category since 1990, with value increasing +7.7%.  Within the category, agave-based spirits grew +15.9% in volume in 2020, overtaking rum to be the third largest spirits category in the US, behind vodka and whisky. Cognac/Armagnac was also a big winner last year, posting volume gains of +20.1%. Both categories are expected to continue their growth path over the next 5 years.   The whisky category showed mixed results, as tariffs negatively impacted single malt Scotch (-6.1% in volume) while bar and restaurant closures dragged down Irish whiskey (-0.5%).

Though trending from a small base, no-alcohol spirits are expected to end 2021 up +31.4% in the US.   Wine resonates with consumers during lockdowns Total wine in the US grew slightly at +0.7% by volume and +1.5% by value in 2020, reversing the volume declines seen in 2019. Both still and sparkling wine volumes were up +0.8%, but still wine is forecast to go back to softening declines as RTDs and spirits grow at faster rates. Despite a non-celebratory 2020, sparkling wine managed to post growth, with Prosecco (especially ros\u00e9 expressions) making up for declines in Champagne consumption.  Low-alcohol wine volumes more than doubled in 2020 in the US, with major brands entering the category offering lower calorie and lower sugar options in sessionable ABVs \u2013 a direct response to RTD occasion overlap pressure. Imported wine volumes grew more than domestic US wine (+2.5% vs +0.3%) from markets such as Chile, Italy, and New Zealand, which did not have tariffs in place.    RTDs set to become second largest beverage alcohol category in the US, in terms of volume consumption  The biggest gains in beverage alcohol consumption in the US last year were seen across the RTD category (which includes the popular hard seltzer sub-category), making RTDs more sizable in volume than total spirits in the US, and by the end of 2021, larger than total wine.  RTDs grew +62.3% by volume in 2020, led by hard seltzers which grew +130%. Hard seltzers represent 56.7% share of the total RTD category in the US, followed by flavored alcoholic beverages (FABs) (25.9% share), and ready-to-drink cocktails/long drinks (6.9%).   \u201cThough the cocktail/long drink sub-category is still comparatively small by volume, the segment grew +52.7% in 2020 with canned cocktail growth spurred by on-premise closures and the on-premise pivot to \u2018drinks to go,\u2019 as well as more at-home consumption and outdoor socialization,\u201d notes Rand.   The IWSR has tracked a rise in more spirit-based RTD launches at a higher price point due to taxes in US, but volumes remain small compared to the traditional malt-based segment. However, several US states have recently passed or are reviewing legislation to reduce spirit-based RTD tax reductions.   The overall RTD category shows no signs of slowing down \u2013 IWSR expects RTDs to grow to be 22% volume share of total beverage alcohol by 2025 (up from 9.6% share currently).   No- and low-alcohol beer is a bright spot for the category Beer continued annual volume declines with a -2.8% loss in the US in 2020, as volume gains in imported beer (+3.1%) weren\u2019t enough to sustain losses in domestic beer volume (-4.4%). Imported beer grew market share, nonetheless, at 21.8%, up from 20.6% in 2019.  -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2951, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93e9babb-e5a3-41ea-b7c8-cd8ae7837d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "93e9babb-e5a3-41ea-b7c8-cd8ae7837d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 161312, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "319b1ce7-c3b1-49de-b1ed-1286858a6d12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Alcohol-Consumption-Increases-in-the-US-in-2020-Press-Release.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 161312, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "02b386f315c5362024f9926a13a5def9763100912007ea662c9d5174016cd01b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR: Beverage Alcohol Consumption Grows in the US / page 3   No- and low-alcohol beer proved a bright spot for the category, however, and the category is expected to continue to grow.

IWSR\u2019s examination of data from 19 markets across the Asia Pacific region shows that total beverage alcohol volume in Asia Pacific decreased by approximately -8% in 2020. IWSR forecasts that long-term volume recovery in the APAC region will return to pre-Covid levels by 2025 (lagging two years behind global alcohol\u2019s forecasted rebound from the near complete shutdown of bars and restaurants in 2020.) With the exception of wine, which is expected to show volume declines at the regional level, each of the other major alcohol categories are projected to post volume growth in APAC (beer at nearly +2%; spirits under +0.5%; ready-to-drink (RTDs) at almost +6%; and cider at over +1% volume CAGR 2021-2025).  \u201cThough an unprecedented downturn, the decline in beverage alcohol in Asia Pacific was less than previously forecast, as several factors ultimately helped the industry last year,\u201d remarks Sarah Campbell, Research Director for Asia Pacific at IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. \u201cThe acceleration of ecommerce, growth of RTDs, strong at-home consumption in key markets, and the resilience of countries such as China and Australia, will underpin the region\u2019s growth going forward,\u201d Campbell adds.   Travel retail, hit particularly hard by Covid-led shutdowns in international travel and tourism, lost over -70% volume in Asia Pacific last year, but IWSR predicts volume in the channel will grow by over +50% in 2021. Green shoots in the region include the Chinese government\u2019s decision to designate Hainan as a duty-free territory for beverage alcohol, boosting global travel retail activity long-term.  IWSR\u2019s comprehensive analysis of the beverage alcohol market in major countries in the region also shows:  Australia: Australia is mostly an off-trade market, so growth in retail was easily able to compensate for on-premise losses in most categories during Covid, and the migration of travel retail sales to the domestic market provided an additional boost as well. In total, beverage alcohol in Australia grew by about +3% last year, the most of any country in the region. The beer category showed volume growth of nearly +3% in 2020, a bright spot against beer\u2019s general declining trend in other global markets. The overall wine category saw a decline, but Champagne performed well, growing by more than +12%. Spirits and RTDs were the two categories that experienced the largest volume gains in 2020. IWSR forecasts that the Australian total beverage alcohol market will soften slightly over the next 5 years. -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3044, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c790f15b-25f9-4e6a-b887-00ee457c762f": {"__data__": {"id_": "c790f15b-25f9-4e6a-b887-00ee457c762f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 163722, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c96f8bf1-7c2a-4343-aa85-3c7db710b98e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 163722, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "d01f0d81d463ce82cb06c26ddd90173ae10367c1fe891c02b0653d924de7a32f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR: Beverage Alcohol in Asia Pacific Markets / page 2   China: The short lockdown in China, the largest alcohol market in the world, is unlikely to have long term impact on consumer behaviour in terms of beverage alcohol consumption. Due to its reliance on the on-trade, total beverage alcohol volume was hit hard by Covid (at close to -6% 2019 to 2020). However, it is expected to grow by nearly +4% in 2021. Flavoured spirits and RTDs performed well in 2020, as did single malts, which is one of the few drinks that Chinese consumers enjoy at home or in small groups (+20% in 2020). Spirits overall, however, were down close to -5% in the country last year (or close to -3% excluding national spirits, such as Baijiu). Ecommerce saw impressive growth in the market from an already large base, and online sales of beverage alcohol in China are expected to continue growing over the next five years, despite the market\u2019s skew to the on-trade.   India: With lockdown in India resulting in the closure of all bars and most liquor stores in the country, total beverage alcohol volume declined by close to -30% last year. The market is expected to rebound, however, to over +8% volume CAGR 2021-2025. Total spirits are forecasted to grow by almost +5% CAGR 2021-2025, and beer is expected to post growth of nearly +13% volume CAGR during that same period. Whisky in India, the dominant spirits category, was down -16% in 2020 but ultra-premium-and-above Scotch enjoyed growth, as did Irish and Japanese whiskies, driven by wealthy consumers in the market. Unlike many other countries in the region, alcohol ecommerce does not play a critical role, due to government regulations and limited channel investment.   Japan: Total beverage alcohol was down close to -5% in Japan in 2020, but the market is expected to rebound to pre-Covid volume levels by 2024, forecasted at over +2% volume CAGR 2021-2025. The ready-to-drink category in Japan represents about 20% of the global RTD market, and grew at close to +12% in 2020. The vast majority of RTD sales in the country go through the off-trade so the category was well-insulated from lockdowns. Total beverage alcohol volume in Japan is forecasted to grow over the next five years, with RTDs projected to grow at nearly +6% volume CAGR 2021-2025.  Philippines: Although total beverage alcohol volumes declined in the Philippines in 2020, the market is expected to post volume gains of nearly +7% in 2021, and will continue to grow over the next 5 years. IWSR forecasts that total beverage alcohol volumes in the Philippines will rebound to pre-Covid levels by 2023. Although beer volumes declined in 2020, wine and spirits volumes both increased (wine by +3% and spirits by almost +2%). Driving spirits growth was gin, up nearly +7% last year \u2013 notable given that the Philippines is already the world\u2019s largest gin market.   Singapore: Total beverage alcohol volume in Singapore was down close to -9% in 2020, driven by beer, which represents over 80% of all alcohol consumption in the market and saw volumes plummet due to decreases in outdoor social occasions and out-of-home dining. About 75% of wine volume in the market goes through the off-trade, which helped that category\u2019s performance (up close to +12%) thanks to increased at-home consumption and less widespread restaurant restrictions. IWSR forecasts that total beverage alcohol volume in the country will grow by about +4% CAGR 2021-2025, bouncing back to pre-pandemic volumes by 2022.  -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3502, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf490ac1-c0d5-4160-8f53-894f6ac01bbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf490ac1-c0d5-4160-8f53-894f6ac01bbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 163722, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21d982b1-92bf-43ab-a40e-4d0605d180a3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Australia-And-China-Underpin-Ongoing-Resilience-in-APAC-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 163722, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "92d8b0edf68db1b97a8953bb3ace3c992967bebb7e8ddc39e86e40c006013775", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR: Beverage Alcohol in Asia Pacific Markets / page 3   Thailand: The economy in Thailand was hit hard by the lack of international travel last year as alcohol sales in the country are quite reliant on Western tourists.

New research from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the leading authority on the global beverage alcohol industry, forecasts that the value of alcohol ecommerce will increase by 42% this year, across 10 core markets, to reach US$24 billion. In comparison, alcohol ecommerce value in those markets grew by 11% in 2019.   The 10 core markets included in IWSR\u2019s new comprehensive Global Ecommerce Strategic Study (Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, and the US) collectively represent over 90% of total alcohol ecommerce value. The report also examined an additional 10 \u201cmarkets to watch\u201d (Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Netherlands, Israel, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Singapore, and the Philippines.) Across all of those 20 markets, IWSR expects the total value of alcohol ecommerce to exceed US$40 billion by 2024.   \u201cConsumers\u2019 increasing proclivity for online purchasing has been driven by necessity in recent months, but these purchasing behaviours are here to stay. As brand owners increasingly invest in the channel, markets must be assessed on their own merits with a bespoke strategy developed. This is especially important as government regulations for alcohol ecommerce may evolve as the channel continues to grow,\u201d says Guy Wolfe, Strategic Insights Manager at IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.    Wolfe adds, \u201cThe forecast size and growth of ecommerce means it can no longer be viewed as merely an interesting niche. Online is now a market in its own right, and one that the IWSR forecasts to equal the Indian beverage alcohol market in value by 2024. The channel should therefore be given an equivalent level of focus and be fully integrated into route-to-market strategies.\u201d   World\u2019s Largest Beverage Alcohol Ecommerce Market, China, Grows at a Slower Pace than Other Markets; US will Overtake China by the End of 2021. Alcohol ecommerce has grown in almost all markets this year, but some have experienced more rapid increases than others. China is currently the largest online alcohol market in the world, however, its growth rate (23% value growth, 2019-2020) has been slower than that of the US, UK, Australia and Brazil. This is because alcohol ecommerce is already reasonably well developed in China, allowing for less room for growth. IWSR consumer research findings show that most (46%) Chinese consumers who buy alcohol online have done so for several years. The market is also heavily reliant on restaurants and bars, where about half of China\u2019s alcoholic drinks are sold. -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e9617c9-9ade-429b-8e70-9b513bca9d3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e9617c9-9ade-429b-8e70-9b513bca9d3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 143753, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e178b58-47d7-4beb-9d8b-4ef03c5b0477", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 143753, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "e034c55678157e219cd77d97ff6a4b34e2624719f9c353ecdc299ffa029ab56f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Beverage Alcohol Ecommerce Shows Rapid Growth / page 2  After witnessing a value growth of over 80% in 2019-2020, the US is poised to overtake China to become the largest alcohol ecommerce market in the world by the end of 2021. Between 2019 and 2024, US total alcohol ecommerce value will grow six-fold, from half that of China to nearly double. Growth, however, is coming from a low base: in 2019, ecommerce represented just 1% of off-trade retail alcohol volume in the US. By 2024, IWSR estimates that ecommerce will account for 7% of total off-trade beverage alcohol volume in the country, compared to 6% in China.    \u201cThis year, there has been a huge increase in awareness of alcohol ecommerce among US consumers, while some states have relaxed legislation to facilitate online sales and home deliveries. IWSR consumer research data shows that in the US, 44% of alcohol e-shoppers only started buying alcohol online in 2020, compared to 19% in 2019. Growth is largely being driven by the omnichannel segment as supermarkets and traditional retailers seek to rapidly enhance their online offering. On-demand players are also expected to gain significant share,\u201d notes Wolfe.   Across the 10 core countries, marketplaces currently account for nearly half of total online alcohol sales by value, but the omnichannel and on-demand channels are predicted to gain share. The value of the Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channel will also grow by almost US$3 billion between 2019 and 2024, at a value CAGR rate of 24% (2019 - 2024).   RTDs Set to Drive Ecommerce Value Growth Through to 2024 Though wine is the dominant ecommerce category in most countries, across the 10 core markets, ecommerce for ready-to-drink (RTD) products is predicted to represent 10% of total alcohol ecommerce value by 2024 \u2013 up from 2% in 2019.   The US is the main market driving RTD category growth, and ready-to-drink products are set to represent 20% of US alcohol ecommerce value by 2024, compared to 5% in 2019. This would make RTDs a bigger online business than beer in the US.    \u201cSpurred by the trend for the category in the market as a whole, the expansion of the US omnichannel and the prevalence of younger legal drinking age consumers in ecommerce, online sales of RTDs are expected to soar in the coming years,\u201d notes Wolfe.   Outside of RTDs, agave-based spirits (tequila and mezcal) and US whiskey are also seeing growth across ecommerce.   Markets to Watch: Mexico, Argentina, South Africa and the Netherlands Among the \u201cmarkets to watch,\u201d the Netherlands is currently the largest for online alcohol sales. But countries such as Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa are also expected to post high value growth this year. Over the next five years, Mexico is projected to generate the greatest incremental value in online sales, at over 60% CAGR , 2019 to 2024.   In the 10 \u201cmarkets to watch,\u201d beer is expected to grow the fastest overall, but trends vary by market. In Mexico, for instance, ecommerce wine is forecast to increase by more than 80% CAGR 2019-2024, while spirits are on track for 50% online growth in the Philippines. -END-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e4882b8-e825-42a6-ac64-72edf796d3ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e4882b8-e825-42a6-ac64-72edf796d3ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 143753, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6900e389-af0d-454c-bd9c-281d3a09f34b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Beverage-Alcohol-Ecommerce-Shows-Rapid-Growth-2020.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 143753, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "3e26cdae633242fb187797931fa726e6862b4e2542ec0204442c094bacd9fecd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Press contact:    Greg Cohen \u2013 press@theiwsr.com, +1 917 714 8237 Other enquiries:  enquiries@theiwsr.com  About the IWSR  The IWSR is the leading source of data and intelligence on the alcoholic beverage market.

Recovery will be boosted by the industry pivoting rapidly  in key \nmarkets, the momentum of ecommerce and RTDs, and increasing sophistication of  the at -home occasion in \nmany markets. Long-term volume recovery is forecasted at +1.5% compound annual growth rate 2021 to \n2025. The two fastest -growing categories, according to IWSR forecasts, are no -alcohol spirits (projected at \n+30.6% CAGR 2021 -2025), and RTDs (+10.2%).  \n \n\u201cIn many global markets, Covid -19 accelerated the impact and growth of key industry drivers, such as the \ndevelopment of ecommerce, premiumisation, the rise of the \u2018home premise, \u2019 moderation , and the need for \nconvenie nce in product  formats ,\u201d says Mark Meek,  CEO of IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the leading \nauthority on the global beverage alcohol market. \u201c These are the trends that will also underpin the \nindustry\u2019s resilience as it pivots to meet consumers where they are  in the years to come .

Though an unprecedented downturn, the -6.2% decline was less than \npreviously forecast , as several factors ultimately helped the industry last year , such as:  acceleration  of \necommerce (up +45% from 2019 , to reach US$29 billion in 2020 ), growth  of RTDs, strong at -home \nconsumption in key markets , and resilience and growth in the US and China.     \n \nAnother pre-Covid trend that will continue to accelerate beverage alcohol recovery is product \npremiumisation.

Based on how the pandemic has unfolded in 2020 so far, IWSR has conducted an in-depth mid-year assessment on the outlook for the global beverage alcohol industry. IWSR reviewed beverage alcohol consumption in 19 key global markets, and the global travel retail channel (representing 75%+ of total global alcohol consumption). The key markets reviewed were Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, UK, US, and the global travel retail channel.  \u201cGiven the incredibly tough measures the industry has continued to face due to Covid-19, it\u2019s encouraging to see that beverage alcohol in the 19 focus countries is only projected to decline by -8% in 2020, rather than by the double-digit losses originally expected. Excluding national spirits such as baijiu and shochu, total beverage alcohol in the 19 focus countries will recover to 2019 levels by 2024. We may see that recover even faster now, given the recent news on encouraging vaccine trials,\u201d says Mark Meek, CEO of IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. \u201cThe rise of ecommerce and the efforts by retailers and on-premise operators to adapt to this crisis, coupled with consumers expanding to new occasions, created a dynamic, albeit challenging, new environment for beverage alcohol.\u201d  The US and China \u2013 Key Growth Drivers of Global Beverage Alcohol \u2013 Prove Resilient Though volume losses in several markets, including Russia, Australia, Japan, and Germany will be under -5%, only the US and Canada are expected to show actual volume growth this year (both at over 2% total volume increases). The 2020 volume consumption increase in the US is in line with 2019 trends, indicating that Covid-19 has not impacted overall consumer demand. However, gains in retail and ecommerce contrast with heavy losses in the more profitable on-premise channel in the US.  China also performed better than initially foreseen at the start of the pandemic, as Chinese consumers \u2013 including 400 million millennials in the country \u2013 have returned to almost all everyday activities. The international spirits market in China, in particular, will see full recovery by 2021. The US and China are key growth drivers of global beverage alcohol, and combined, they account for one third of global volume consumption and over 40% of global value. -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2892, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be9ad390-3755-4de9-9e32-c17083e5fa8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "be9ad390-3755-4de9-9e32-c17083e5fa8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 139853, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "65d6eb48-a078-4999-9de7-c6a39c90d40d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 139853, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "0f72b304146c2d24124e2f17ac45fadf8ef2a611c488f27633a4a5100941dc0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR Reports 2020 Global Beverage Alcohol to Perform Better than Expected / page 2    Brazil and Japan have also proved remarkably resilient through 2020, and are expected to recover to pre-pandemic volume consumption levels in 2021. While 2020 will see a drop in the all-important beer and cacha\u00e7a categories in Brazil, both are expected to bounce back quickly. Still wine will be a winner there during 2020, the only category in absolute growth, although RTDs are also starting to make their mark. Japan continues its journey away from traditional products such as shochu and sake, with beer proving particularly resilient, especially in the face of a strongly-advancing RTD category.  Markets such as India and South Africa, which experienced partial or full shutdowns of all beverage alcohol during the pandemic, and Mexico, which saw beer banned for some time, unsurprisingly will experience some of the largest volume losses this year. Global travel retail, impacted by the huge disruption in business and leisure travel, is estimated to see volume consumption down -68% in 2020.  Ready-to-Drink (RTD) Sector is the Only Category to See Growth in 2020. Low- and No-Alcohol Segment will Continue to Resonate with Consumers In terms of specific categories, only the ready-to-drink (RTD) sector will see volume growth this year (+43%), largely driven by strong performance in the US, which is the largest RTD market in the world by volume. Global consumers have shown a propensity for refreshing, flavourful and longer-to-consume drinks, which bodes well for RTDs. The category is also well suited to the off-premise, which further boosted its popularity during lockdowns. RTDs are expected to post volume gains of +21.8% compound annual growth rate 2019-2024, stealing share primarily from the beer category. In the US, the RTD category will be bigger by volume than the spirits category by the end of this year.  Total volume consumption of international spirits (which excludes national spirits such as shochu and baijiu), is projected to be down by -7.2% in 2020, however is set to recover in full by 2022. Within spirits, Canadian whisky and US whiskey are the only categories expected to grow in volume consumption in 2020. US whiskey will also be one of the most resilient spirits through to 2024, along with Cognac/Armagnac, agave-based spirits, Irish whiskey and Japanese whisky.  Total wine and beer are both forecasted down about -9% in 2020 and are each unlikely to regain volumes for several years. Low-and-no alcohol beer, however, is a bright spot for the category, as moderation and wellness trends continue to resonate with consumers. Low-and-no alcohol beer remains resilient through to 2024, with a volume CAGR of 5.9% (2019 \u2013 2024). No-alcohol spirits will grow at a slightly lower pace, hampered by the absence of a functioning on-premise channel in 2020, seen as key to bringing the category closer to consumers.  Within wine, sparkling wine volume consumption is anticipated to recover to 2019 levels by 2023. Premium-and-above Prosecco is expected to be least impacted by Covid, and premium-and-above still wine is forecasted to recover lost volumes by 2022.    -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3196, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "306d987d-df21-4cce-9a38-99695d4d59af": {"__data__": {"id_": "306d987d-df21-4cce-9a38-99695d4d59af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 139853, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02415163-d251-476c-82db-acb6e68d9ec0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Performs-Better-than-Expected.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 139853, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "660fcac64399b75b513580596eeeec18819124bbef9ed14a0b1bcb8eaa4e5d4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR Reports 2020 Global Beverage Alcohol to Perform Better than Expected / page 3    As the On-Premise Suffers Long-Term Damage, Alcohol Ecommerce Sees Strong Growth New IWSR research also examines Covid-19\u2019s impact to the on-premise, which will have suffered long-term, potentially permanent, damage in many markets. The IWSR estimates that only four of the key markets will see a market share gain over 2019 levels in the on-premise by 2024 (Russia, Poland, Australia, and Colombia). In many markets, Covid-19 has accelerated a long-term pre-crisis trend of a declining traditional on-premise.  The clear winner during Covid lockdown has been alcohol ecommerce, which has increased in all focus markets. The value of ecommerce in 10 core countries (Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK, US) is forecast to grow by over 40% in 2020, to reach US$17bn, and is expected to grow to over $40bn by 2024.  Consumer Sentiment is Mixed, with Comfort Levels Varied Across Markets In a recent IWSR study focusing on consumer behaviour shifts across key markets, findings indicate that adult consumers\u2019 drinking behaviours have remained steady in most markets, with increases driven by generally younger, urban, and more affluent consumers who are relatively comfortable in the new normal. Consumers are not reporting much shift in their preferred categories, though they do report spending more on whisky, Cognac, Champagne, wine, tequila, craft beer, and gin.  \u201cCovid-19 has had a polarising effect on the world economy and thereby the global beverage alcohol market. Large markets such as the US and China have survived the best, while less developed regions and countries such as Africa, Mexico and Argentina have unfortunately suffered more,\u201d adds Meek. \u201cVery premium high-end spirits have also held up well, while low-end and value products have seen gains in struggling markets as Covid-19 leads to downtrading. Some of the more standard middle ground categories, blended Scotch for example, have lost share.\u201d  -END-   Press contact:    Greg Cohen \u2013 press@theiwsr.com, +1 917 714 8237 Other enquiries:  enquiries@theiwsr.com  About the IWSR  The IWSR is the leading source of data and intelligence on the alcoholic beverage market.

The IWSR Global \nOpportunities in Low - and No -Alcohol  report examines market sizing by volume , key players in the industry, \non-trade analysis, product innovation, and important consumer trends.  \n\u201cThe \u2018Dry January\u2019 movement isn\u2019t new, but one of the reasons we \u2019ve heard so much more about it this year is \nthe broader trend  that points to consumers\u2019 increased interest in physical and mental health. And that\u2019s \ncreating an interesting shift in consumer preference for low - and no -alcohol beverages, outs ide of soft drinks,\u201d \nsaid Mark Meek, the IWSR\u2019s CEO. \u201cFor leading producers of beverage alcohol, this obviously presents \nconsiderable opportunity to develop new products , claim their share of the category  and ultimately grow \nrevenue.\u201d  \nThe IWSR \u2019s study indicates that a t present, the low - and no -alcohol sector is poorly served, with few clear \ncategory leaders. Though  forecasted to grow significantly, overall the current marketplace for low - and no -\nalcohol products is still small in most parts of the world. In  the UK, for instance, low-/no-alcohol brands \nrepresent only 1.3% of the country\u2019s total beverage alcohol market. In the US that number is even smaller at \n0.5%. Nonetheless,  research indicates that consumers  are actively looking to reduce their alcohol con sumption \nand they  universally support the notion of low-/no-alcohol beverages if they can find products that meet their \ntaste expectations .  \nMost bars and restaurants around the world that were surveyed by the IWSR for this forward- looking study \noffered no n-alcohol beer, while non -alcoholic wine was notably absent. (Non -alcohol beer is growing rapidly, at \nthe same time that low -alcohol beer volumes are declining.) Bartender attitudes towards low - and no -alcohol \nproducts varies widely by market as well. In  almost all markets, the IWSR \u2019s research shows  that the off- trade \nchannel (beer/wine/spirits retailers) offer s significantly more selection of low - and no -alcohol products than \nbars and restaurants.  \nSpecific  market  trends in low/no alcohol include:  \nUnited States  \nThough 52% of US consumers surveyed in the IWSR \u2019s study report that they\u2019re trying to reduce their alco hol \nintake, over 70% of people say they have not yet considered drinking low - or no- alcohol beverages.

IWSR Drinks Market Analysis\u2019 annual Global Trends Report, released this week, examines developments and identifies opportunities around the world for the beer, wine, spirits and mixed drinks market. Among the key current and emerging trends identified by IWSR analysts\u2019 on-the-ground research are: Global Sophistication \u2022 New entry-level brands are helping aspirational consumers in developing markets to discover unfamiliar beverage alcohol categories. \u2022 In developed markets, premiumisation and an attitude of \u201cless but better\u201d is driving consumers towards crafted products \u2013 often with a hyper local spin. \u2022 More niche and localised flavours are starting to gain traction (for instance, spirits made with locally foraged botanicals). \u2022 Increasingly niche and personalised experiences are helping curious consumers to connect with their favourite drink categories (e.g. monthly subscription clubs and experiences such as \u201cmeet the maker\u201d events at craft distilleries and breweries). \u2022 Wine education continues to spread in developing markets, especially throughout Asia.  Lifestyle and Ethical Choices \u2022 The rise in consumer interest in wellness has fuelled development of no- and low-alcohol products, and \u201cbetter-for-you\u201d beverages that are low-calorie, sugar-free, gluten-free, and that feature natural nutrients and healthy ingredients. \u2022 Consumers are looking for ways to decrease their environmental impact on a micro level, such as adopting plant-based diets, reducing air travel, shunning plastic waste and consuming water and other natural resources more responsibly. Some consumers now expect drink brands to hold themselves to similar standards throughout the production chain. \u2022 People are also gravitating to companies and brands that are more authentic in their support of charities or local communities.   Digital Engagement \u2022 Personalised and interactive marketing campaigns are becoming key. \u2022 Technological innovations, such as smart labels, are changing the way consumers interact with products, companies and brands.   -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2460, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cd40bfe-d5bc-49ba-a5b1-7c5c14a5fa0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cd40bfe-d5bc-49ba-a5b1-7c5c14a5fa0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Press-Release-Global-Trends.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Press-Release-Global-Trends.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 77162, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ed691d27-587a-4d59-bc89-cccbe3394605", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR-Press-Release-Global-Trends.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR-Press-Release-Global-Trends.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 77162, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "15689f02a46ece7f7e03b81799e0fdfd062bbdb42066183ab333f6b64d0f30a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR Global Trends / page 2   Social Experience and Inclusivity \u2022 Drinks tourism, pop-up events, festivals and interactive spaces are encouraging people to plan drinks-led experiences  \u2022 In today\u2019s restaurant scene, themed cocktails and unique food and drink pairings can be a core component of the dining experience and may even provide a route into novel cuisines. \u2022 Macro social and economic changes bring new participants into the drinks market, and as a result, products evolve to accommodate the newcomers\u2019 needs and preferences.

Shipment costs and delays, \ncontainer shortages, higher packaging costs and rising energy costs continue to challenge the \nmarket. Meanwhile, soaring inflation and a changing political landscape have contributed to \nrecruitment challenges in the hospitality sector. In the US, for example, inflat ion hit its highest \nlevel in 40 years in November 2021, up 6.8%, while the UK\u2019s supply chain and recruitment \nstruggles continue to be impacted by the fall -out from Brexit.  \nNevertheless, consumers are increasingly comfortable with returning to the on -trade,  \nespecially the millennial and Gen X cohorts. Ecommerce has developed into a sophisticated \nand nuanced channel, and digital engagement has become a crucial part of the customer \njourney. As ecommerce and the on -premise grow in strength, structural long -term  changes to \nthe off -trade B&M will present a very different beverage alcohol market landscape in the \nyears to come.  \nHere are the key trends driving the beverage alcohol market landscape, as consumer \nbehaviours continue to shift and guide market strategies and product innovation.  \nEmergence of non -traditional luxury categories  \nAlthough international status spirits (spirits sold at US$100 and above, excluding Baijiu) \nsuffered declines in 2020 at a rate that exceeded that of the total global spirits market, IWS R \nexpects a bullish rebound in line with previous growth levels of 2014 -2019.  \nFuture category growth will be underpinned by increasing levels of wealth and new market \nentrants \u2013 especially in Asia and the US. IWSR consumer research, for example, shows that  \n39% of urban affluent Chinese alcohol drinkers said they had spent over RMB 500 (approx. \nUS$79) on a bottle of alcohol to drink at home in the first half of 2021.  \nAs new consumers enter the market, a key disrupter to the current international status spiri ts \nlandscape is segment diversification and the emergence of niche status categories \u2013 such as \nagave -based spirits, Irish whiskey, US whiskey and Japanese whisky, which all registered \nabsolute growth in 2020.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2556, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01ab6424-666e-45fb-a941-3319c117e68b": {"__data__": {"id_": "01ab6424-666e-45fb-a941-3319c117e68b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR_Key-Trends-Driving-the-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Industry-in-2022.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_Key-Trends-Driving-the-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Industry-in-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 92074, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1b6d940-3137-454c-b87a-60f17578daa2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR_Key-Trends-Driving-the-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Industry-in-2022.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_Key-Trends-Driving-the-Global-Beverage-Alcohol-Industry-in-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 92074, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "5d7d30f5653d1bdc191d2bc79b96e7058f70bcca8557f9deb2b8b5b0f99cd442", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Substituters vs Blenders: moderation choices a re driven by consumption occasion  \nNo- and low -alcohol products are becoming more approachable for consumers as they are \nincreasingly accepted as a lifestyle and societal norm. Channels solely dedicated to selling \nalcohol -free drinks  for adult occasions are also on the rise, with dedicated ecommerce sites, \nretailers and bars coming to market.  \nA distinction in how and when consumers choose no - versus low - products is becoming \nincreasingly evident. Across key markets, the majority of no/low consumers can be identified \nas \u2018Substituters\u2019 \u2013 those who  use no - and low -products in place of full strength for certain \noccasions.  \nIWSR consumer research s hows that in the UK, for example, 40% of no/low consumers are \n\u2018Substituters\u2019, with LDA Gen Z and millennials (46% and 41% respectively) more likely to \nsubstitute than Boomers (36%).

A similar trend can also be seen in other markets, such as the US.  \nTapping into no -alcohol occasions, new technologies are also enabling producers to launch  \nalcohol -free products that offer mood -enhancing or functional benefits, many with \ningredients such as CBD, nootropics and adaptogens. These products focus on how \ningredients will make consumers feel, and are seen as an alternative way to enjoy traditional  \nalcohol occasions \u2013 tapping into health conscious (and stressed out) consumers.  \nEcommerce landscape becomes more nuanced as sub -channels blur  \nThe value of ecommerce increased  by almost +43% in 2020 across 16 key markets, up from \n+12% in 2019. IWSR data sh ows that by 2025, in these markets ecommerce is projected to \nrepresent about 6% of all off -trade beverage alcohol volumes, compared to less than 2% in \n2018.  \nAs ecommerce alcoholic -drinks sales develop, the number of retailers is increasing and the \nrange of  business models they employ is becoming more diverse and nuanced . Distinctions \nbetween different ecommerce channels, and even between online vs offline p urchasing, are \nbecoming increasingly irrelevant to consumers.  \nThis is leading to a blurring of lines between online sales channels \u2013 for example, \nomnichannel retailers are establishing logistics partnerships with on -demand services in \norder to offer faster  delivery; on -demand platforms are using \u2018dark stores\u2019 to improve delivery \ntimes and so become more like marketplaces; and marketplaces are establishing networks of \nphysical stores.  \nA more sophisticated home -premise impacts the return of the on -premise  \nChanges in living location, work commutes and hybrid working policies mean that consumers \nare spending more time at -home and in local on -premise venues.

This \nmarks a clear diversion from RTD innovation so far, with the vast majority of the global RTD \ncategory currently sitting within the standard -and-below price bands.  \nThe move towards premiumisation  will appeal to spirits and wine brand owners, as most of \nthe value growth within the broader spirits and wine categories over the past decade has \ncome from the premium -and-above segment.  \nWhile flavour is the primary purchase driver for RTD selection by consumers in key markets, \nalcohol base (as well as cocktail type) are also significant motivating factors, with consumers \nmore likely to perceive spirits -based products as being of higher quality.  \nSpirits -based RTDs already dominate the category in most key markets \u2013 apart from in \nMexico, and, most notably, in the US, where malt -based RTDs dominate. Although spirits -\nbased RTDs hold a minority share in the US, their small volumes are driving the development  \nof a super -premium segment \u2013 the first to be seen across the global RTD landscape.  \nDiversification as category lines blur  \nPeople are switching with increasing frequency between beverage options or trialling \ncompletely new beverages.

Influential figures \nacross the industry, as well as consumers, are increasingly looking for drinks companies to \nshow a clear commitment to sustainable practices.  \nSolidarity with local brands and bu sinesses has also been a key trend during the pandemic, \nand is one that is closely associated with consumers\u2019 sustainable mindset. For example, \nconsumer research from IWSR shows that 48% of US alcohol drinkers say their purchase \ndecisions are positively in fluenced by a company\u2019s sustainability or environmental initiatives; \nrising to 72% among Brazilian alcohol drinkers, and 70% of urban affluent Chinese alcohol \ndrinkers.  \nShaky international supply chains and relative price were not the only drivers of this trend: in \nmany cases, consumers reported they also wanted to \u2018do their bit\u2019 for the local economy. \nBuilding on this crisis response, local brands may hope to reinforce their status for the long \nterm by emphasising sustainability, quality and community valu es. \nExternal pressures  \nFactors beyond consumer demand continue to impact production and route -to-market for \nthe global beverage alcohol industry. Rising packaging costs, container capacity and other \nsupply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and environ mental change will impact some \nsuppliers significantly. Some companies may therefore need to be more tactical and adjust \nsome of their near -term market and brand strategies to adapt to the economic and operating \nenvironment.  \nBrand owners should also be con scious of false positives witnessed through 2020 and 2021 \nthat will revert to previous historical trends, especially as international travel resumes. \nParticularly for premium beverage alcohol, the past two years saw a marked shift in where \nproducts were pu rchased \u2013 a trend that may reverse as the market normalises.

The buoyant no/low category gained share within the total beverage alcohol market last year to 3%, and total volume is forecasted to grow by +31% by 2024, according to the new \u201cNo- and Low-Alcohol Strategic Study 2021\u201d from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.    The comprehensive new study examines the no/low space in 10 focus countries, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, South Africa, Spain, the UK and the US, representing 75%+ of global no- and-low alcohol consumption.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a moderation trend that\u2019s sweeping across key global markets, and that\u2019s bringing with it increased demand for reduced alcohol, or alcohol-free drinks,\u201d says Mark Meek, CEO of London-based IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. \u201cBrand owners will have an important role to play in the future development of no- and low alcohol, as increasing the breadth of products available to consumers and their price points will support category growth and broaden its appeal.\u201d  While the traditional alcohol market\u2019s greater exposure to bars and restaurants saw it struggle in the wake of mass venue closures across the world, no/low categories have seen largely positive, albeit muted, growth, with a volume consumption increase in the 10 markets of approximately +1% in 2020.  Declines in Germany, Growth in the US and South Africa No/low alcohol beverages overall are on the rise globally, but some markets proved more resilient than others over the last year. Germany, the largest no/low alcohol market by volume, experienced almost a -5% drop in consumption in 2020, due to reliance of the no/low beer segment in the on-trade at bars and restaurants. Meanwhile, the US, as the next largest market, is currently the most dynamic, with the no/low segment registering over +30% increase in 2020 despite the enormity of the challenges faced by the industry.    Looking ahead, all 10 focus markets in the IWSR study are projected to continue on their growth path through to 2024, with much of the absolute volume growth driven by the US, Germany and Spain. Of those countries, South Africa is expected to experience the highest CAGR volume rate (2020 to 2024), at approximately +16%, albeit from a low base.    -more-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2554, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d9dfa8a-fa7b-4836-b6a9-c24f88ac65ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d9dfa8a-fa7b-4836-b6a9-c24f88ac65ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152728, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "afb4f00f-5466-44c1-9539-3f427c7fb1a1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152728, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "d745e11fd597a316fbe4a8a132c4a9faf85ca49be2e1e5c4c400f09f9646d8a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "No- and Low-Alcohol Products Gain Share / page 2  Beer Dominates No/Low Alcohol, Spirits Post Largest Volume Increases Driven by early innovation and investment in quality, the no/low beer and cider category dominates the overall no/low market, commanding a 92% share of the total no/low alcohol segment. Thanks to the investment in the category from the major brewers, consumers are becoming more familiar and accepting of no/low beer as a quality product. While several key beer players continue to steer the category, the market is fragmented with a number of smaller brands vying to establish themselves as market leaders in this space. The segment is likely to become even more of a focus for smaller craft producers who are able to bring a diverse range of products to the market in future.   No/low beer registered a flat performance for the 2019-2020 period, at +0.5%. In contrast, the no/low spirits category \u2013 which has only 0.6% share of the no/low market \u2013 increased volume sales by +32.7%, largely thanks to new interest in home experimentation among consumers. New product development and increasing consumer demand for no/low spirits will see the category experience the largest volume CAGR rate, 2020 to 2024, at approximately +14%.  Meanwhile, no/low RTD volume grew by +10.2% in 2020, largely driven by a trend for functional alcohol-free RTDs in Japan. No/low wine increased by +4.9% last year, having made strong gains in the US and the UK. Both categories will continue on their growth trajectory through to 2024, each expected to command a 7% to 8% volume CAGR 2020 to 2024.     \u2018Low\u2019 Versus \u2018No\u2019 Broadly, no-alcohol products are outperforming low-alcohol beverages: in 2019-2020, the \u2018no-alcohol\u2019 sub-category increased volume by +4.5%, while \u2018low-alcohol\u2019 decreased by -5.5%. The decline was driven by the poor performance of traditional low-alcohol beer brands in the high-volume markets of Germany and Spain. However, newer low-alcohol products like spirits and RTDs are particularly resonating with consumers in markets such as the US who are becoming more mindful of what and how much they consume.  \u201cLow-alcohol spirits is smaller than no-alcohol, but extremely strong growth is expected to continue as companies launch low alcohol by volume (ABV) versions of established brands, and consumers show less concern about 0.0% ABV in this category,\u201d explains Sophia Shaw-Brown, Senior Insights Manager at IWSR.    58% of Consumers Drink No/Low and Full-Strength Alcohol on Same Occasion Examining the consumer drivers and occasions for drinking no- and low-alcohol beverages, IWSR research shows that people are mainly choosing to drink no/low beverages to \u2018avoid the effects of drinking alcohol,\u2019 but also highlights a marked preference for moderation over abstention: more than half (58%) of no/low consumers report that they choose to switch between no/low and full-strength alcohol products on the same occasion, while only 14% state they do not drink alcohol at all.  The most popular occasion to consume no/low products is when relaxing at home (64%), and the category\u2019s suitability to low-tempo occasions is a key reason why it has been so resilient during the pandemic. IWSR research also indicates that consumers are consistently pointing towards taste as key to drinking no/low alcohol, which underscores a finding that consumers are generally willing to pay a similar price for a no/low beverage as a full-strength one.  -END-", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3462, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7db2430-a73c-482a-99ae-e574f29634c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7db2430-a73c-482a-99ae-e574f29634c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152728, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3ae8131-9d48-474a-a9c6-c75c167d6a20", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/IWSR_No-and-Low-Alcohol-Gains-Share-Within-Total-Beverage-Alcohol-2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 152728, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a4fd95092d201a326a8fbb6c03c791d34b49c4db64fcd79e6908997d81b867b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "No- and Low-Alcohol Products Gain Share / page 3    Press contact:    Greg Cohen \u2013 press@theiwsr.com, +1 917 714 8237 Other enquiries:  enquiries@theiwsr.com  About the IWSR  The IWSR is the leading source of data and intelligence on the alcoholic beverage market.

While \nbeer, cider and international spirits have not yet reached 2019 volumes, they have all met or surpassed 2019 \nlevels in value terms. Wine has also surpas sed 2019 value levels, though overall global category volumes are \nexpected to continue on a downward trajectory.  \nWhere are the growth markets for beer ? \nBeer rebounded strongly in several major markets once Covid restrictions ended, and is forecast to add \nsignificant value to total beverage alcohol over the next five years, especially in Asia -Pacific and Africa, which \ncombined will add close to US$20 billi on to the beer category by 2026. Ongoing volume growth will be seen in \nBrazil; the strong rebound in Mexico and Colombia that began last year will continue; and there will be some \nrecovery in China.  \nWhat is the outlook for the spirits category ? \nTotal spirits volume grew +3% in 2021, and value increased by +15%. This growth was driven primarily by \nconsumers continuing to treat themselves to higher -end products, while also becoming more comfortable with \nmaking cocktails at home during pandemic lock downs \u2013 a learned behaviour that consumers can quickly pivot \nto when inflation hits. IWSR forecasts that spirits volume will grow by +5% and value by +15% (2021 \u201326). \nTotal whisky, which commands about a quarter of all global spirits volume (excluding national spirits such as \nbaijiu, soju, and shochu), is expected to post volume growth of +23% and value growth of +29% over the next \nfive years. Growth will continue in wh isky\u2019s largest global markets \u2013 India and the US. The whisky category in \nIndia will see volume growth of +23% (2021 \u201326). In the US, by the end of this year, whisky will be bigger than \nvodka by volume \u2013 for the first time in almost two decades.  \nGlobal volume growth will also continue in almost all other spirits sub -categories over the next five years, \nincluding gin (+24%), Cognac (+23%) and rum (+13).  \nWill growth in agave -based spirits plateau ? \nLast year saw higher than expected growth in agave -based spirits, which is forecast to deliver significant global \nvalue increases 2021 \u201326, at +67%. The US is the world\u2019s most valuable market for agave -based spirits. In the \nUK, the category\u2019s most valuable market in Europe, agave -based spirits are forecast to grow by more than \n+88% in value 2021 \u201326, albeit from a relatively low base.  \nWhat is driving growth in the wine category ? \nGlobal still wine volumes were down -2% last year, but value was up by +5%, as the \u2018less but better\u2019 trend \ncontinues to underlie the trajectory of the still wine category. Noteworthy gains in wine were seen in the \nsparkling category as consumers returned t o celebratory occasions in full force with the lifting of Covid \nrestrictions. Champagne posted volume growth of +24% last year, and other sparkling wines were up +7.5%. \nOver the next five years, the global wine category is forecast to continue on its traje ctory of long -term volume \ndecline ( -1%, 2021 \u201326), but will see value gains of +5%.  \nWill premiumisation continue ? \nPremiumisation continues unabated for spirits and wines in the premium -and above price tier. Premium -plus \nspirits (priced US$22.50+) are forecast to grow by more than +50% in value in the Americas 2021 \u201326; over \n+40% in Africa and the Middle East; over +20%  in Europe, and just under +20% in Asia -Pacific.

Globally, wine in the premium -and-above price band (US$10+) grew by +12% in \nvalue last year, and is forecast to increase in value by +16% 2021 \u201326. \nBuoyed by at -home consumption, how will the ready -to-drink (RTD) market evolve post -pandemic ? \nRTDs have been a stand -out category during the pandemic, increasing in volume by +14% in 2021 \u2013 on top of \n+26% growth in 2020. By volume, the category is now about a third of the size of the global spirits category, as \nwell as the global wine category. Glo bally, RTD products are expected to grow by +44% in volume and +51% in \nvalue over the next five years.  \nCategory growth will continue in the world\u2019s largest RTD markets, the US and Japan. In Japan, the RTD category \nis expected to expand in volume by more than +30% over the next five years, driven particularly by flavoured \nalcoholic beverages (FABs). In the U S, propelled by the popularity of hard seltzers, the RTD category saw \ncontinued volume growth at +15% last year; RTD value growth (+22% last year) will begin to outpace volume \ngrowth in the US, as the category matures and higher priced spirit -based RTDs ga in traction in the market. At a \nlower growth rate than in previous years, hard seltzer volumes in the US are expected to overtake those of still \nwine within the next two years.  \nWhere will we see growth in no/low -alcohol ? \nThe no/low -alcohol category grew by over +10% last year, and will continue to grow over the next five years, \nalbeit from a relatively low base. Notable growth last year came from the no -alcohol spirits segment in the UK: \nvolume increased by over +80% in 20 21, after tripling in size in 2020. Looking forward, no -alcohol beer will add \nthe most volume to the global no/low segment over the next five years.  \nWhat consumer trends are driving future consumption ? \nMillennials led the global consumption bounce -back last year, being the generation least affected by the \npandemic\u2019s restrictions; these consumers (now aged 25 \u201340) are more adventurous than older generations, \nand with their significant spending power and fo cus on \u2018less but better,\u2019 they tend to purchase more premium \nproducts. Millennials, and in some cases Gen Zs, are amongst the highest spenders on wine in markets such as \nAustralia, Sweden, the US, and the UK. It remains to been seen if this trend continues , with governments \nwithdrawing Covid support packages and a probable increase in unemployment rates in many markets.  \nThe underlying consumer trends that continue to provide tailwinds for the global beverage alcohol market \ninclude: \u2018better for me\u2019 consumer drivers, such as moderation, ingredient quality and functional benefits; \n\u2018better for the world\u2019 values, including sus tainability and social equality; and online interaction, both via \necommerce and social media, as well as new ways to engage through NFTs and the metaverse. Global alcohol \necommerce continued to grow last year (+16% in value 2020 \u20132021), although this was at  a slower rate than in \n2020 (+45% in value 2019 \u20132020).  \n\u201cChallenges remain, including whether bars and restaurants will continue to attract consumers who have \ngrown comfortable with ecommerce and at -home consumption; whether consumers will accept price \nincreases on their preferred brands; and whether inflation and supply -chain issues will lead to consumers \ndown -trading and gravitating towards local rather than imported products,\u201d adds Meek. \u201cWe\u2019re living in an \nage of uncertainty, and these are uncharted waters for the industry.

While every downturn has its own characteristics, the IWSR looked at the impact of the 2008 financial crash and \nassess whether similar patterns are likely to unfold in the wake of the Covid -19 pandemic.  \n While the pandemic and its economic consequences may share some common aspects with the \ndownturn of more than a decade ago, such as increased at -home consumption, pric e stagnation and \nfalling beer sales, there are also marked differences.  \n \nThese include not only the enforced closure of the on -trade and severe restrictions on international \ntravel, but also the fact that the BRIC markets are less likely to prop up demand this time, and the likely \ndisproportionate impact on smaller and craft producers. The speed and extent of any recovery \u2013  which \ncame relatively quickly following the 2008 crash \u2013  will depend on the path of the virus, how quickly \nrestrictions can be lifted a nd the impact of any future Covid -19 surges.  \n \nChina to the rescue?  \nDuring the global economic downturn of 2008/9, the BRIC markets provided a much -needed silver \nlining: while global alcohol consumption in 2009 was essentially flat, it would have fallen by 2% without \nthe contributions of the BRIC nations, where consumption volumes rose 3.7% in 2009, according to \nIWSR figures.  \n \nWith the expansion of these markets over the past decade, the industry cannot depend on them to \nshore up demand this time around \u2013  although China\u2019s recent easing of lockdown restrictions might \nbring pockets of renewed growth.  \n \n\u201cChina is likely to provide a boost, especially if no further outbreak occurs, but Russia, India and Brazil \nwill likely not provide as much of the demand this tim e around,\u201d says IWSR CEO, Mark Meek. \u201cThe new \n\u2018BRIC\u2019 is Africa and I suspect that this region will be heavily affected by the low price of oil and the impending Covid -19 crisis likely to develop across the continent.\u201d  \n \n-more -", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2583, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91f882a7-3b88-468c-b9b0-ccf13362d046": {"__data__": {"id_": "91f882a7-3b88-468c-b9b0-ccf13362d046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 96008, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbace64b-d097-4158-986f-d8a54459b340", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 96008, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a584f9982c68b8bb04ae72187f1f5eecd9977b7a2b7312f4056138832935072b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR / page 2  \nTravel retail woes  \nTravel retail sales suffered in 2009, with wine and spirits volumes dropping by 8%, but recovered in \n2010, rising by 12% as the worst of the crisis passed. This time around, however, there is continued \nuncertainty about social distancing at airports and on  board aircraft, and many airlines are in severe \nfinancial trouble.  \n \n\u201cIt is very hard to see a recovery as quick as last time until a vaccine is widely available,\u201d says Meek. \n\u201cThis will have long and deep ramifications for the whole travel retail channel a nd the relationship \nbetween suppliers, operators and landlords.\u201d  \n \n \nCraft crisis and diversity reversal  \nThe years since the 2008/9 crisis have been marked by expanding numbers of suppliers and increased \ndiversity of products on offer, especially with the ri se of craft brewing and distilling. However, these \nbusinesses are typically disproportionately reliant on \u201ccellar door\u201d and on -premise sales, both of which \nhave been heavily affected by the pandemic.  \n \nThe last economic crisis also saw a \u201cshake- out\u201d of smal l brands from retail as operators seek to \nmaximise returns, which Meek believes will happen again. \u201cBoth these factors spell a very difficult time \nlooming for the majority of craft producers, unless they have size already,\u201d he says.  \n \n \nBad for beer, better for spirits and wine  \nBeer and cider were hard- hit in the 2008/9 economic crisis, due to a combination of duty rises, an on -\npremise slump and increased at -home consumption, which tends to favour spirits and wine. Beer and \ncider sales dropped from 6% growth in 2007 to a 1% decline in 2009, according to IWSR figures. We will \nlikely see the trend continue, with ongoing social distancing measures also likely to curtail sports \nfixtures, major events and festivals \u2013  all traditionally strong drivers of beer and cid er consumption.  \n \nMeanwhile, Champagne consumption, often tied to celebratory drinking occasions, will likely be hit \nhard, with a slow recovery to reach pre -virus levels. Sparkling wine, which has declined steeply in the \nshort -term, should recover as lockdo wn restrictions ease in markets where it is viewed as an everyday \ndrink, but sparkling wine celebration markets will likely take longer to return to growth.  \n \n \nThe new on- premise  \nThe closure of much of the global on -trade has had a huge impact, but there wi ll be no swift recovery as \nrestrictions are eased. In China, consumers have so far been reluctant to return to the on -premise, and \nsome reopened bars and nightclubs have closed again as social distancing proves difficult to uphold.  \n \nSpain\u2019s restriction of the reopening on -premise to outdoor spaces and 30% capacity will likely prove \ndifficult for many operators, and sales are likely to remain limited at first. But, the gradual re -opening of \nthe on -premise is the step needed to give brand owners and their distributors a path forward.   \n \n-more -", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2a6e520-b6b8-4800-a98f-98144cd388a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2a6e520-b6b8-4800-a98f-98144cd388a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 96008, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e9696ef-908f-4d38-93f6-5de1a0fcf34b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Drinking-in-an-economic-downturn.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 96008, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "22fc36f4d0847f4e668c52510cb24584b781c2c1afbb7c60cc3a5b070a9623e1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IWSR / page 3  \nValue suppressed  \nIn 2008 and 2009, standard - priced wines and spirits declined and growth for premium -and-above \nflattened, with a clear shift to low price and value brands.

Led by the brands White Claw and Truly, hard seltzer volume in the US is currently about 82.5m nine-liter cases (which is already larger by volume than the leading spirits category in the US - vodka). IWSR forecasts that by 2023, the category will more than triple, to reach over 281m cases. Hard seltzer and other \u201cseltzer-like\u201d products command a market share of 2.6% of all beverage alcohol in the US, up from only 0.85% a year ago. IWSR also estimates that hard seltzer ecommerce sales will increase from a current share of 0.8% to nearly 2% by 2023 as more consumers realize they can purchase these products online. The IWSR Hard Seltzer Report is also the first study of its kind to define, examine and quantify the size of the entire hard seltzer universe, a category which not only includes malt-based products, but also those produced from wine and spirits. These seltzer-like products, with similar product attributes as leading malt-based brands, add another 7m cases to the total seltzer universe in the US. \u201cHard seltzers are far from a fad, they\u2019re growing at a spectacular rate, and increasingly, hard seltzer producers are pulling consumers from other beverage alcohol categories, not just beer. Combined, hard seltzers and other canned seltzer-like products (vodka soda, as an example) will drive the total ready-to-drink category, making it the fastest-growing beverage alcohol category in the US over the next five years,\u201d says Brandy Rand, COO of the Americas at IWSR Drinks Market Analysis. IWSR also conducted a consumer opinion and attitude study about hard seltzers, and found that over half (55%) of US alcohol consumers surveyed drink them regularly, at least once a week. The research also shows that while hard seltzers appeal to younger generations of consumers, the category spans all ages and demographics, reaching a broader segment of the population. Consumers cited \u2018refreshment\u2019 as the top hard seltzer attribute that appeals to them. \u201cThe rise of hard seltzers shows there was a segment of consumers underserved by the current beverage alcohol market who were looking for alternatives that were refreshing and flavorful, but also low-calorie and low-sugar,\u201d adds Rand. \u201cThese products also meet the growing consumer demand for convenience, and appeal to people that enjoy popular cocktails like the vodka soda, and wine spritzers.

For beverage alcohol, connection often revolved around the joy of \nsocialising with friends and family and this now needs to be adjusted. Brands are quickly tryi ng to \nestablish a new relevance in a global market that has become unrecognisable in the space of just a few weeks.   \n Mark Meek, CEO of IWSR, comments, \u201crelevance is paramount during a crisis like this. Social content \nneeds to reflect the reality of the si tuation we are in, while also being purposeful in one of three ways: \nhighlighting essential information, supporting the community, or offering entertainment and engagement while consumers are at home.\u201d  \n  \n\u201cBrands will need to take a more inventive approach to social media in the coming months, but should \nremember to keep honesty and community at the heart of their communication,\u201d says Meek.  \n \n\u201cFor now, social media will not serve as a means to promote an aspirational lifestyle, but a way to cope \nwith the new  normal we are all living.\u201d  \n Below are some examples of the engaging ways that brands can help to get their messages out to their \nconsumers whilst in isolation.  \n \nEngage with new skills  \nCocktails are becoming more prevalent on the stay at home agenda with cocktail making being a new skill that individuals are hoping to learn with the time they now have on their hands.

In keeping with its brand identity, \nBeavertown Beer has launched Instagram Live Draw- Alongs that are hosted by its Creative Director.  \n \nVirtual tours of wineries, breweries and  distilleries can also help consumers connect with their favourite \ndrinks brands in an environment that isn\u2019t always available to them, offering added intrigue.  \n \nSupporting ecommerce  \n\u201cMany people are exploring home drinking and delivery services for the f irst time during lockdown and \nsocial distancing.

Regulation has made \nthe online retailing of alcohol more complicated than other sectors and this has stifled development , but this is \nchanging.  \nIWSR  Drinks Market Analysis\u2019 global database now capture s just how effective drinks players have been at \nselling digitally. Although variances inevitably exist between markets, the results for 2018 show that 1.8% of \nthe value of all alcoholic drinks traded around the globe is now sold through ecommerce . \nIt is wine that has best harnessed the selling power of the online retail environment. Last year as much as 3.6% \nof all wine value s ales stemmed from ecommerce  outlets, a figure that translates into nearly US$8bn of sales. \nThe rapid expansion of wine sales online has even threatened the viability of independent \u201cbricks and mortar \u201d \nwine stores in the UK. Online wine sales in the country  have reached 6.5% of total sales value, prompting one \nleading wine retailer, Majestic, to announce that they are to sell off much of their retail estate to concentrate \non their online business, Naked Wines.   \nThe extensive number of wine producers and the  diversity of choice has meant that a culture of \nexperimentation has always existed within the wine sector. The online environment has proved to be well \nplaced to service wine drinkers\u2019 curiosity and to educate and inform consumption choices. The dramatic \nexpansion of online wine marketplaces like Vivino, which after just nine years of trading  now claims to have  10 \nmillion  different wines and as many as 35  million  users, has illustrated just how compatible wine selling is \nwith in the digital space.  \nSales of spirits through ecomm erce  may not be as pronounced as wine , but IWSR research shows that around \nUS$6.5b of spirits were sold online in 2018, a figure that represents 2% of all global spirits \u2019 value sales. For \nexample, ecommerce  is reported to now be Pernod Ricard\u2019s fastest gro wing channel.  \nDirect selling on own ed online platforms has proved less effective for spirits operators than partnerships or \nacquisitions with established online retailers and delivery services, perhaps because it compromised choice to \nexclusively sell their own brands. The recent trend has been for operators to partner  with existing online \nplatforms to maximize  exposure and to showcase their brands from a different angle to consumers.  \nThe development of the online marketplace is happening at different spee ds with drinkers in some markets \nquicker to adopt new purchasing practices and habits than others. The reported 800m Chinese internet users \nhave been quick to embrace the advent of ecommerce .  The explosion in smart phone use, social media apps \nand mobile ecommerce  has facilitated this shift in buying habits and meant that 6.5% of off-premise sales of all \nalcoholic drinks are now ordered online in China.  \nThe ecommerce  channel has proved particularly popular for wine sales in China. Encouraged by fierce \ncompetition, wh ich has ensured low prices and fast delivery, online sales now account for 9% of sales value \u2013 \nthat is a fifth of all off -premise wine sales , as well as  online spirits sales of almost 4% .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3569, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79c7fbaa-532f-416b-9376-2af5679d4148": {"__data__": {"id_": "79c7fbaa-532f-416b-9376-2af5679d4148", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Impact-of-Ecommerce-on-Beverage-Alcohol-July2019.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Impact-of-Ecommerce-on-Beverage-Alcohol-July2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 58214, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "380bab86-71bb-43d9-a66b-2e93c293a5d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Press-Release-IWSR-Impact-of-Ecommerce-on-Beverage-Alcohol-July2019.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/Press-Release-IWSR-Impact-of-Ecommerce-on-Beverage-Alcohol-July2019.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 58214, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "bf8f2214eb32b40781affbb14fb695a024cfd94b9c0bd721fd890c8544fc978b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Even in markets like China where ecommerce  penetration is already comparatively high, it can be assumed \nthat the Ecommerce  channel will continue to take share from \u201cbricks and mortar \u201d retail.

According to preliminary data from IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the leading authority on the \nglobal beverage alcohol market, the Irish whiskey category  posted an 8.6% volume increase in the US in \n2019 versus the year prior.  \n  \nThough Irish represents only 2% of the total spirits volume in the US (and 7% market share among whiskies), it\u2019s one of the fastest- growing spirits categories in the US. Over the p ast five years, Irish \nwhiskey volume has increased 13.4% compound annual growth rate, and IWSR forecasts the category \nto continue to grow.\n \n  \nPremiumization is a key driver for the category\u2019s sustained interest and innovation. In 2019 alone, IWSR \nhas tracke d almost 30 new Irish whiskey brand lines that have entered the US market at a premium or \nabove price band. As part of the trend towards premium offerings, Irish whiskey producers have been releasing products with age statements similar to those of Scotch,  reaching up to 21 years in the barrel.\n \n  \n\u201cWe continue to track high growth numbers for brands like Jameson, Tullamore Dew, Redbreast, Teeling, Proper No. Twelve, and Slane whiskey in the US, says Adam Rogers, North American Research \nDirector at IWSR Drink s Market Analysis. \u201cInterest in Irish whiskey has been led primarily by Jameson for \ndecades, but now the establishment of more distilleries in Ireland has contributed to an increase in not \nonly Irish whiskies, but other categories like Irish gin as well.\u201d\n \n  \nIn 2010, there were only four distilleries in Ireland producing and selling Irish whiskey. Today there are more than 30. But this influx of new Irish distilleries and brand choices isn\u2019t the only factor fueling the category\u2019s strong performance in the US . Consumer excitement and appreciation for all whiskies \nremains strong. Led by the recent boom in US whiskey, this is a trend that is also a significant \ncontributor to the growth of Irish whiskey.\n \n  \nAccording to newly -released preliminary figures in the IW SR US Beverage Alcohol Review (US BAR) \ndatabase, available to IWSR\u2019s global customers, Irish whiskey\u2019s 8.6% volume growth in 2019 outpaces that of US whiskey, Canadian whisky, and Scotch in the US.

The study suggests that between 1990 and 2017, alcohol intake has jumped \nby as much as 70%. Importantly , the study anticip ates a further per capita rise of nearly 18% to 2030, \nsomething that would put into jeopardy the World Health Organi zation\u2019s targets for alcohol reduction.  \n\u201cIWSR Drinks Market Analysis has tracked a similar rise in per capita alcohol consumption during the  27-year \nperiod and actually record ed a marginally higher rise of 74% in 100% alcohol intake ,\u201d says Mark Meek, IWSR\u2019s \nCEO.  \u201cMore recent trends might , however , question whether the momentum is in place for the alcohol sector \nto realise the continued growth levels predicted to 2030. \u201d \nIn the 10 years between 1990 and 2000, alcohol intake increased by a fifth , accelerating to a quarter in the next \ndecade. The most recent 10-year period has , however , seen a considerable slowdown, with consumption \ngrowth dropping to 17%.  Although the study accepts there will be a drop -off in the growth rate, the scale of \nthe rise appears bullish even with the anticipated rise in fema le drinkers and higher wages in low- and middle -\nincome countries.  \nIn many of the lower - and mid -income countries, the illicit trade, which goes under the radar, has traditionally \nbeen a significant part of the market and some of the alcohol growth can be accredited to consumers \nupgrading to branded alternatives which do feature in the recorded figures. An upturn in these \u2018visible\u2019 sales \ndoes not equate to an increase in consumption. A rise in regulated, taxed and ultimately safer alternatives \nshould be see n as a positive development.  \nThis is particularly relevant in Africa where the IWSR track s the amount of alcohol imbibed as having ballooned \nnine -fold since 1990. For instance, leading wines and spirits player Diageo carefully price s its products to \nappeal to all income groups , allowing drinkers at the lower end of the spectrum to upgrade to their cheaper \nbrand offerings from the invisible illicit segment.  \nThe approach adopted by the industry in selling alcohol products has also shifted as drinks play ers recognise \nthat if they are too successful at selling volume , then there will be an inevitable public relations backlash. There \nis now a strong industry ethic towards fostering a culture of responsible drinking in all markets rich and poor. \nThis is exem plified by the world\u2019s largest brewer, AB InBev\u2019s ambitious Global Smart Drinking Goals. These \ninclude a commitment to \u201censure no- or lower -alcohol  beer products represent at least 20% of  AB InBev's \nglobal  beer volume by the end of 2025\u201d . If per capita doe s reach the level forecasted in 2030, then all these \ninitiatives will have had a very muted impact.  \nMany drink s operators are now focused more on generating value than volume and this is borne out in the \npremiumisation of the market and the rapid emergence of the craft movement. The IWSR \u2019s figures show that \nwhile the overall global wine and spirits market has slipped by -1.4% in the last fiv e years, the volume of drinks \nthat fall into the \u2018 premium -and-above\u2019 segments have risen by a fifth.

In a newly published report examining the status spirits landscape, IWSR Drinks Market Analysis, the leading authority on the global beverage alcohol market, shows that the value of the status spirits market is $8.3bn (excluding baijiu), and increasing at a value compound annual growth rate of 7% (2014-2018), significantly ahead of the total global spirits market at 2% value CAGR.   \u201cThough we conducted our study prior to the current COVID-19 situation, when we look at similar past events, such as SARS and the 2008 financial crisis, luxury goods and status spirits in particular have always recovered to previous levels,\u201d says Mark Meek, CEO at IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.   For example, IWSR data shows that between 2008 and 2012, global prestige-plus spirits (generally $100+) grew 82% in volume, and almost 230% in value, which reinforces the resilience of high-end spirits after economic challenges.  Adds Meek, \u201calso, our research shows, the majority of status spirits are most often sold in fine wine and spirits retail stores and via ecommerce \u2013 more so than in bars and restaurants \u2013 which bodes well for these products in this current climate.\u201d  Nonetheless, he also points out that it\u2019s important to note that the status spirits market can be quite dependent on Chinese consumers and tourists, as well as global travel retail, so those are areas which will certainly be watched very carefully.  Status spirits are outgrowing their lower-end counterparts in almost all categories. Particularly driving this growth are the established status categories of Cognac and Scotch, but growth will be much faster in less developed categories such as US whiskey and tequila. These, along with Irish whiskey and rum, are all building their respective categories at the high-end, and are supported by specialist retailers in key markets. Status baijiu, almost all of which is sold in China and global travel retail, stands in a league of its own at $33.2bn in value.  The IWSR Status Spirits Strategic Study examined eight key spirits categories in eight major focus markets (including travel retail) which together account for 93% of the global status spirits market by value.

The majority of value is generated in the $100 to $250 bracket, though the $250 to $1,000 segment is expected to grow the fastest.  The study suggests that the higher end of the status spirits market is best built on solid foundations \u2013 today\u2019s purchasers of $150 bottles are tomorrow\u2019s purchasers of $1,500+ bottles. That highlights the importance of accessibility (availability of product, at the right price points), especially to attract new and younger legal drinking age consumers. To make it easier for these buyers, for example, brands should consider experimenting with smaller bottle sizes for sampling.  In the ultra-prestige sector, individual expressions such as Louis XIII and Hennessy are the primary drivers of the Cognac category, while interest in Scotch is often based on a strategy of offering products in a series. Brands such as The Macallan, Glenfarclas, The Balvenie, Laphroaig, Dalmore, Glenlivet, and others have generated several hundred million dollars in revenue for their limited-edition collections and annual release series.  Another developing area in the status Scotch market is the sale of individual Scotch whisky casks which usually command sizeable sums. This growing interest in Scotch casks, already estimated at $40m, will likely also inspire the emergence of similar models built around bourbon, rum, and US whiskey.  \u201cThough the status spirits market is relatively small in size, these are highly coveted and often very rare and allocated products that appeal to affluent and aspirational spirits aficionados and collectors, and yes, sometimes to people only seeking that badge value,\u201d adds Meek. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique and nuanced sector which has definitely benefitted from the general trend towards premiumisation, and also by the younger generation who continue to seek out luxury, and find it in high-end spirits.\u201d  The IWSR Status Spirits Strategic Study also includes market-specific comprehensive on- and off-channel and ecommerce analysis, detailed company and brand level competitive data, and consumer analysis.  -END-  Press contact:    Greg Cohen \u2013 greg.cohen@theiwsr.com, +1 917 714 8237 Other enquiries:  enquiries@theiwsr.com  About the IWSR  The IWSR is the leading source of data and intelligence on the alcoholic beverage market.

Instead, beer and wine seem to be the popular choice with more than half (56% and 55% respectively) saying they have tried it and roughly a quarter (24% and 22%) calling it their favourite alcoholic beverage.\n\nWhisky is seen as a preference among males, especially GenX respondents while beer finds favouritism with younger adults (GenZ & millennials). Although wine consumption in India is low, women appear to be driving its growth in the market.\n\nAmong those who consider whisky a favourite, a large majority (86%) claim to be occasional drinkers, either drinking on special occasions (birthday, etc), socially or only on weekends. In comparison to this, regular drinkers of whisky (who drink anytime, daily or most evenings in the week) are fewer (22%).\nThe most popular occasions to have whisky are- at a formal conference or office party, while relaxing at home and at a house party or in a club with friends.\n\nCalorie information is also important as three in five (60%) said it is extremely or somewhat important for them to know the calorie content in alcoholic beverages.\n\nFurthermore, roughly one in ten brand loyalists and switchers (11% and 8%) said they would try a new brand if it had a lower calorie content, an insight brands may want to focus on given the increased emphasis on health and fitness following the pandemic.\n\nStickiness to their favourite brand is higher among beer and wine lovers as compared to whiskey favourers. They survey also found that GenX are way more likely than GenZ drinkers (74% vs 33%) to say they are open to trying new brand options, while the latter are more likely to stick to their favourite brand (48% vs 10%).\n\n\n\" We see consumers more willing to switch brands and have lower loyalty to a favourite brand possibly due to pandemic related constraints which not only reduced social opportunities to drink outside of home but also the easy availability of preferred brands,\" said Deepa Bhatia, General Manager, YouGov India.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0,

the\nannual Collection media tasting in the Barossa\nValley, this wine was both a contrast and a\ntrump card. It\u2019s not often I score a wine 99\npoints and I never go to 100, but this wine\nscored a hands-down 99 points. Sadly, it\u2019s not\ngoing to be affordable to most wine lovers, as\nit\u2019s AUD $1,180 (there\u2019s that number again) a\nbottle*. But a great wine it certainly is, display\u2010\ning a stunning array of aromas and flavours on a seamlessly elegant palate\nstructure.\nPart of its allure for me was the absence of oak character\u2014it was all aged in\nFrench hogsheads, the critical factor being that none of those barrels were\nnew. All were one year old\u2014at least \u2018second fill\u2019 in winemaker jargon. Oak\ndoesn\u2019t show. The grapes were sourced from two of the most prized blocks\nof Penfolds\u2019 Coonawarra vineyards, Block 5 and Block 10.\nThe 2020 Grange, itself an exceptional wine, is priced just below Bin 180 at\nAUD $1,000.\nGrange is right on form, the biggest differences to my palate being the Bin\n180 is gorgeous right now whereas Grange, in typical style, needs more\ntime, its tannins being more blocky and grippy, and its oak being much\nmore assertive (the usual 100% new American oak hogsheads).

Sourced from the Steinhauer Vineyard, this wine\nincorporates 22% cabernet franc and shows the harmony and elegance allied\nwith power typical of cabernets from this area of the Napa Valley.\nOf the French wines, the Penfolds x Dourthe II 2022 impressed the most.\nIt\u2019s a Bordeaux/Coonawarra blend, 64/32% (they don\u2019t say what the other\n4% was), and is a marvellous wine, a tribute to the blender\u2019s art, perhaps.\nThe third in the series, it\u2019s the first to be 100% cabernet sauvignon (no mer\u2010\nlot), which I think is a plus.\nThe Chinese wine, 2022 CWT 521 Cabernet Sauvignon Marselan, is from\nNingxia, and of special interest is the inclusion of 23% marselan, which is\none of the varieties newly approved for planting in parts of the Bordeaux re\u2010\ngion. Marselan is a cross between cabernet franc and grenache and is said to\nbring some of the character of cabernet franc but be better suited to hotter,\ndrier conditions.\nThe regular Penfolds reds released annually in\nthe Collection are all as we might expect: very\ngood and typical, while two of the chardonnays\nwere an exception. In my view, the Reserve Bin\nA 2023 and Yattarna 2022 were unready to be\nshown, the Reserve Bin in particular seeming\ncompletely out of sorts. The 2024 Eden Valley\nRiesling Bin 51 also seemed to have been\nrushed into the bottle and I\u2019m pretty sure it will be tasting much better in a\nyear or two. The track record of these wines indicates that given adequate\ntime, they will not disappoint, but they were not ready, in my view. The\nReserve Bin A was especially disappointing and some tasters were even\nmore critical of it than I was.\nBy way of contrast, the cheapest\nchardonnay on show, Bin 311\nChardonnay 2023, was looking\nvery good, and value at AUD $55.04/10/2024, 01:50 The Penfolds Collection 2024 something special \u2013 The Real Review\nhttps://www.therealreview.com/2024/07/18/the-penfolds-collection-2024-something-special/ 4/8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2112, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c66bf0c5-797a-4645-8ff2-6cc7215c2a47": {"__data__": {"id_": "c66bf0c5-797a-4645-8ff2-6cc7215c2a47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The Penfolds Collection 2024 something special \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds Collection 2024 something special \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 325631, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5dfd8829-1dc0-4caa-9cb8-386ae91d6edb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The Penfolds Collection 2024 something special \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds Collection 2024 something special \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 325631, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "cc723cb278405a179e74ae75af2f8b840a36c588886ae128897f9d791cb5b223", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Penfolds Peter Gago introduces the Penfolds 2024\nCollection.

From the 1950s on\u2010\nwards, the style of Penfolds red wine that came\nto be universally recognised was the type pion\u2010\neered by legendary winemaker Max Schubert\nwith his famous Grange. A multi-regional blend,\ndark, ripe and profound, new-American-oaky, resting on big tannins and\nvery ageworthy, it was a prototype for generations of Australian red wines\nto come. But within the Penfolds stable there were always wines that\nbucked the trend.\nAlongside that hearty \u2018House Style\u2019, Penfolds winemakers have experi\u2010\nmented thoughtfully and skilfully to introduce variations on the theme.\nStarting way back in Grange\u2019s early days, when Max Schubert\u2019s winemak\u2010\ning colleague John Davoren resurrected the 1890s St Henri, the idea of \u201cal\u2010\nternative\u201d Penfolds red wine styles has been a constant theme, despite the\nprimacy of the Grange type.\nSt Henri was lighter, less overt, less robust than Grange. It was made from\ngrapes of similar high quality, untouched by new oak, and generally made\nless formidable and opulent. In his outlook John Davoren was a more con\u2010\nventional Australian winemaker than Max Schubert, but St Henri still occu\u2010\npied an important place in the Penfolds product hierarchy. Until the 1970s it\nwas a true alter ego of Grange \u2013 with the same price tag.\nThat famous Penfolds red wine style was established by Schubert, and it\ncontinued to be championed by subsequent chief winemakers. Peter Gago,\nwho currently heads up the Penfolds team, refers to Grange and the other\nMax Schubert-inspired wines like Bin 389 as \u201cthe classics that are still there\nfrom Max\u2019s day. The rock-solid anchors.\u201d\nBut Gago also points out that Penfolds winemaking was never completely\nset in stone.\n\u201cIt was always a voyage of exploration,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as resources04/10/2024, 01:51 The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review\nhttps://www.therealreview.com/2020/10/13/the-penfolds-alter-ego-wines/ 3/6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2103, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13b30f9a-23bb-4430-a285-95f604d7cf7c": {"__data__": {"id_": "13b30f9a-23bb-4430-a285-95f604d7cf7c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 174514, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f688249c-71f0-4293-8a6f-67a03db38ad4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 174514, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "b66f529ebbecc48ae7b94bf81601fe4fbbccfe4f47e8415b25e6f0334ed53624", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "y yg p , y\nexpanded and the wines evolved, experimentation continued.\u201d\nThere have only ever been four Penfolds Chief Winemakers, and all have\nmaintained the tried and true House Style well, tweaking it here and there in\nthe quest for constant improvement, but at the same time developing\nground-breaking variations on the theme.\nAfter Grange, Max Schubert developed the Bin range of reds that became\nthe company\u2019s mainstream, typified by 389, 28, 128 and 707, but he also\nmessed around with a legendary range of experimentals and show wines,\nwith a plethora of out-of-the-norm Bin numbers like 60A, 620, and oddball\nnames like Kalimna Burgundy.\nDon Ditter, who followed Schubert as Chief Winemaker in 1975, continued\nthe experimentation, developing Magill Estate Shiraz in 1983. Where\nGrange was a blend of regions, Magill was a single vineyard wine from\nPenfolds original estate in the Adelaide suburbs. Grange matured in\nAmerican oak. Magill employed a proportion of French. Grange was all\nabout power, Magill was finesse.\nDitter also expanded the Penfolds house style into a new market with the\ncheaper but true to style Koonunga Hill, and he re-released Bin 707, a sort\nof Grange made from cabernet sauvignon after a hiatus of six years.\nNext, in 1986 at the Penfolds helm was John Duval who introduced a wine\nknown oddly as Red Winemaking Trial, or RWT and lately Bin 798. Grange\nwas all about muscle, structure and concentration, RWT was fleshy, fra\u2010\ngrant, smooth. Only French oak was employed, and it was 100% Barossa\nrather than a blend.\nDuval continued producing legendary specials like 90A and expanded the\nBin range with 407, a much less macho cabernet than 707, and Old Vine\nBarossa Valley, now Bin 138, a three-way blend of shiraz, grenache and\nmataro given only old oak. John Duval also set in motion the quest for a\n\u201cwhite Grange\u201d that resulted in Yattarna, a super-premium chardonnay to\nrank with Australia\u2019s best.04/10/2024, 01:51 The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review\nhttps://www.therealreview.com/2020/10/13/the-penfolds-alter-ego-wines/ 4/6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2070, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6956ebe5-82b3-4987-9d7f-c40279da05bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "6956ebe5-82b3-4987-9d7f-c40279da05bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 174514, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58477edd-e282-465b-a7eb-caa28a5e73f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/The Penfolds alter ego wines \u2013 The Real Review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 174514, "creation_date": "2024-10-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-04"}, "hash": "fd359873c4b9fb7144dc91fa061a586abab3e4e2269244f9a53bd18ad0779cc7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Current Chief Winemaker Peter Gago took the reins in 2002 and enthusiast\u2010\nically embraced the Penfolds culture of experimentation and established it\nworldwide.

The pattern of alcohol use was categorized as: \u2018almost every day\u2019, \u2018almost once a\nweek\u2019 and \u2018less than once a week\u2019. The information was segregated for the urban and rural settings. Information was also available on the typeof alcoholic beverage used by the respondents. The ztest for differences in proportions was carried out for the study variables.\nResults: Findings suggest a 22.37 and 39.02% reduction in the proportion of men and women who reported alcohol use, respectively. The\nproportion of men reporting \u2018almost every day\u2019 and \u2018about once a week\u2019 consumption of alcohol increased by 24.19 and 7 .14%, respectively.\nConclusions: With the caveats of expected limitations of surveys, the \ufb01ndings suggest an overall decrease in alcohol use in India, though the\nproportion of men with more frequent alcohol has increased. There is a need to strengthen the investment in the initiatives targeted at theharms due to alcohol use.\nINTRODUCTION\nAlcohol use-related harm is a major public health concern\n(Griswold et al ., 2018 ). The burden due to alcohol use is\ngreater in developing countries ( Shield and Rehm, 2021 ). In\naddition, the patterns of alcohol use among Indians, including\nhigh per-capita consumption among the drinkers and high\nprevalence of heavy episodic drinking, further add to the harm(\nWHO, 2018 ).\nDespite its public health importance, the change in the\nextent and pattern of alcohol use in India has not been studiedand documented systematically. Such information is of great\nvalue not only to document the changing patterns and trends\nover the past years but also to plan the policy and programsaimed at addressing the harms related to alcohol use in the\nfuture.\nThe National Family Health Survey (NFHS) of India offers\na valuable and unique data set that captures information on\ndifferent health variables using a nationally representative\nsample from across the country ( International Institute for\nPopulation Sciences and ORC Macro, 2000 ). Also, since the\nfourth (2015\u20132016) and fifth (2019\u20132021) rounds of the\nsurvey have used a comparable methodology, it offers anopportunity to make comparisons between the two data sets.\nWe aimed to explore the change in extent and pattern ofalcohol use in India over the course of 4.5 years (between 2015\nand 2019).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4000, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "226b1b17-d6d6-4930-a0f3-04fc468be09a": {"__data__": {"id_": "226b1b17-d6d6-4930-a0f3-04fc468be09a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "674", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7dec326-7e44-4e30-8964-86fa195d7d23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "674", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "83ae5e3ec44972b3161e3a372ae9e085a732263fee8372435135409d7353229c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "487d3341-ae83-4ed9-a549-8c423031cdce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "674", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "cb3ef7c5b5470f9497d516488f5c871981b4d9ce44fd570ec7aa5f229d107e26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Such information is of great\nvalue not only to document the changing patterns and trends\nover the past years but also to plan the policy and programsaimed at addressing the harms related to alcohol use in the\nfuture.\nThe National Family Health Survey (NFHS) of India offers\na valuable and unique data set that captures information on\ndifferent health variables using a nationally representative\nsample from across the country ( International Institute for\nPopulation Sciences and ORC Macro, 2000 ).

Information was collected\nfrom 724,115 women and 101,839 men for NFHS-5 and from\n699,686 women and 112,122 men for NFHS-4.

These were selected\nwith probability proportional to size, followed by a randomselection of 22 households in each Primary Sampling Unit at\nthe second stage.

The total of the three categories of\npattern of drinking totals to 100%\nwere designed to provide estimates of all key indicators at the\nnational and state levels, as well as estimates for most key\nindicators at the district level.\nVariables of interest\nWe used unit-level data from both rounds of NFHS, and whilederiving the estimates an appropriate sampling design was\nused with the help of the \u2018svy\u2019 command in STATA analytical\nsoftware (\nStataCorp., 2017 ). Both rounds of the survey col-\nlected information on the proportion of men and women who\nreported alcohol use (using the Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Question-\nnaire). NFHS-5 also enquired about the use of alcohol in theHousehold Questionnaire. The patterns of alcohol use were\ncategorized as: \u2018almost every day\u2019, \u2018almost once a week\u2019 and\n\u2018less than once a week\u2019. The information was segregated for\nthe urban and rural settings. Information was also available\non the type of alcoholic beverage used by the respondents.\nData analysis\nThe data were compiled using Microsoft Excel software. The z\ntest for differences in proportions was carried out for the study\nvariables. The analysis was carried out using the Epitools-\nEpidemiological Calculators ( Sergeant, 2018 ).

The reduction was more among women.A similar trend in reduction was reported by an earlier study\nbased on the report of the first phase of the NFHS-5 (\nBalhara\net al ., 2022 ). We had previously commented on a lack of\nsystematic evaluation of the policy and programs targeted\nat addressing harms associated with the use of alcohol. Due\nto the lack of such information, it is difficult to attribute\nthe reduction in the proportion of Indians reporting alco-\nhol use to one or more factors. There is a need to gener-ate data on the effectiveness of the current programs and\ninterventions.\nSecond, there was an increase in the proportion of men\nwho reported use \u2018almost every day\u2019 among men. This was\nrecorded across all age categories. This observation validates\nthe caution that we expressed in our previous publicationwhile interpreting the data available at that point in time\n(\nBalhara et al., 2022 ). Over the years different surveys have\nreported that an overwhelmingly large proportion of Indiansare classified as abstainers. As a corollary, the total alcoholconsumed in India is consumed by a relatively smaller propor-\ntion of the population. The Global Status Report on Alcohol\nand Health 2018 by WHO estimated a 38% increase in per-\ncapita alcohol consumption among individuals aged 15 yearsand above in India during the period 2010\u20132017 (\nWHO,\n2018 ). In fact, the total alcohol per-capita consumption (APC)\namong drinkers in India was high at 18.3 L and 6.6 L ofpure alcohol, respectively, for men and women (aged 15 years\nor more). The average volume of alcohol consumption is a\nwell-established contributor to the alcohol-associated burdenof disease and injury (\nRehm et al., 2017 ). This is even more\nconcerning given the projection that the APC in the country\nis likely to increase over the next couple of years ( Anon,\n2022 ). A decreasing trend in current drinkers that is not in\nkeeping with the APC data from India has been reported in\nprevious studies ( Rastogi et al., 2021 ). The increase in the\nproportion of men reporting \u2018almost daily use\u2019 is a concerning\nfinding in this context. Although the NFHS does not cap-\nture data on alcohol use disorders, it can be inferred thatgiven the pattern of drinking among men in India those who\nreport almost daily use might be at greater risk of or are\nlikely to have developed problematic patterns of alcohol use.These findings call for action to address the frequent use of\nalcohol among men across all age groups. There is a need\nto invest in both prevention-oriented and treatment-orientedinterventions. The services for screening, early detection and\nintervention also need to be scaled up.\nThird, not only there was a reduction in the proportion of\nwomen who reported alcohol use, but the proportion of those\nwho reported alcohol use \u2018almost every day\u2019 was also reduced\nin NFHS-5. Alcohol use among women has been consistently\nreported to be relatively lower among Indian women ( Lal\net al ., 2015 ). However, the observations from NFHS data\nare not in keeping with the media reports of an increase\nin alcohol use among women in India ( Anon, 2019 )(Desai,\n2020 ).\nFourth, the current use of alcohol was reported in the states\nwith a prohibition on alcohol. However, it was lower than the\nnational values.\nThe findings of this study should be interpreted in the\ncontext of certain limitations of the NFHS data set.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 1507, "end_char_idx": 5590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "924fbb2b-5a0f-403d-8b77-22683e4fd0f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "924fbb2b-5a0f-403d-8b77-22683e4fd0f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "676", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b9026c58-a090-4fdc-b032-a769d25b7b6b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "676", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "ad2765d44ae3345f528e4538d08ef9e456c68d1a0049c86b26d617c1953ca71d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "65a07c6f-57d7-46c7-80f4-7372726e97b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "676", "file_name": "agac035.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/agac035.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 292500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "dd0666c21c7c121ab1af8ce7a21be71f9480d26fed8bcb1b75d6f73a439fa344", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The services for screening, early detection and\nintervention also need to be scaled up.\nThird, not only there was a reduction in the proportion of\nwomen who reported alcohol use, but the proportion of those\nwho reported alcohol use \u2018almost every day\u2019 was also reduced\nin NFHS-5.

Second, the primary objective of the\nNFHS is to provide essential data on health and family welfare\nand emerging issues in these areas. The sample size has been\ncalculated accordingly. A larger number of female respondentswere included as compared with men in both NFHS-4 and\nNFHS-5. However, NFHS offers a data set that is collected\nnationally, periodically and uses a comparable methodology.\nThird, we have some concerns about the way some of the types\nof alcoholic beverages were defined for the purpose of thesurvey. This concern stems from the observation that a large\nproportion of respondents reported the use of \u2018wine\u2019 which is\nnot one of the most common forms of alcoholic beverage usedin India. Fourth, concerns about underreporting of alcohol\nuse in surveys have been expressed (\nLivingston and Callinan,\n2015 ). The response rate among men in both rounds was\n92%, whereas among women it was 97%. Although it was\nnot uniform across different states and was relatively lower\nin some (for example Chandigarh in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 and Delhi in NFHS-4), the response rate among men in\nboth rounds was 92%, among women it was 97%. Fifth,\nNFHS captures information only on those aged 15 years ormore. The age of initiation of alcohol in India was reported\nto be 13.6 years in a national survey among children and\nadolescents (\nDhawan et al., 2017 ). So, we could not comment\non the trend of alcohol use among those aged <15 years.\nFinally, the second phase of data collection for some states\nin NFHS-5 overlapped with the 40-day period of prohibitionof alcohol sale in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis is likely to have impacted the pattern of alcohol use.\nDespite these limitations, NFHS data are a valuable resourceto comment on the change in the extent and pattern of alcohol\nuse in India.\nIn conclusion, although there has been a reduction in the\nproportion of Indian men and women who reported alcohol\nuse between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5, the increase in the propor-\ntion of men who reported alcohol use \u2018almost every day\u2019 is afinding that requires greater focus and intervention. There is\na need to strengthen the investment in the initiatives targeted\nat the harms due to alcohol use.\nCONTRIBUTIONS\nY.P.S.B. conceptualized the article.

The underlying social dynamics are particularly important in the case of consumer goodsthat implicate high future energy demand and are, hence, also key for climate mitigation. This paper investigatesthe impact of social factors, with a focus on \u2018status perceptions\u2019, on car and appliance ownerships by urban India\nhouseholds. Using two rounds of the household-level data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS,\n2005 and 2012), we test for the impact of social factors in addition to economic, demographic, locational, andhousing on ownership levels. Starting with factor analysis to categorise appliances by their latent characteristics,\nwe then apply the bivariate ordered probit model to identify drivers of consumption among the urban house-\nholds. We find that while income and household demographics are predominant drivers of car and applianceuptake, the household\u2019s perception of status, instrumented by a variable measuring expenditure on conspicuous\nconsumption, emerges as a key social dimension influencing the uptake. The results indicate how households\nidentify themselves in society influences their corresponding car and appliance consumption. A deeper under-standing of status-based consumption is, therefore, essential to designing better demand-side solutions to low-carbon consumption.\n1. Introduction\n\u201cKeeping up with the Joneses\u201d shorthands conspicuous consump-\ntion intended to convey social status and relative positional good [1\u20133].\nIt highlights the zero-sum game involved in buying a bigger car or a\nlarger house just to keep equal social status with neighbors and col-\nleagues. Far from being an US-focussed phenomena, similar dynamics\nare playing out globally. An understanding of those dynamics becomes\nalso increasingly relevant, as the increasing externalities of consump-\ntion, in particular their direct and induced greenhouse gas emissions,\nshift these social interaction from a zero-sum game to a negative-sum\ngame.\nIndia as the world\u2019s second most populated country, with car\nownership expected to grow 9-fold from 2014 to 2040, with appliance\nownership and electricity demand increasing by 5\u20137.8 percent annually\nbetween 2015 and 2030, deserves to be at the center of analysis. Yet,India\u2019s current (c.2018) per capita energy consumption at 23.35Gigajoules (GJ) [4]is well below the world average of 76 GJ [5]. This\nlow level offers high potential to shape consumption behaviour to fa-cilitate sustainable, low-carbon and where possible, consumption-re-\nducing energy choices that are consistent with high wellbeing. In fact,\ndemand-side solutions that achieve wellbeing for all, while maintaining\ninduced energy and resource demand within limits are possible but\nremain underexplored [6\u20138]. An increased focus on end-user pre-\nferences, habits, social norms and structural factors that shape energy\ndemand is warranted \u2013 keeping up with the Patels.\n1\nIncome has been studied as a predominant driver of energy con-\nsumption alongside other socio-economic factors.

Above\nthis threshold, with the increasing affordability of a wider range of\ngoods, households define themselves by their purchases and experi-\nences that signal their relative standing in a group or meet the average\nconsumption standards of their community [22]. The social value that\nhouseholds seek through their behaviour and consumption patternsthen translates into \u201cstatus\u201d [23]. This dimension of status remains\nhowever underexplored in the investigation of household consumptiondecisions.\nHere, we investigate consumption choices of households focusing on\nstatus consumption in urban India. Using microdata for urban house-\nholds in India, we validate this growing relationship for car and ap-\npliance uptake by applying panel regression methods and an instru-\nmental variable (IV) approach. We begin with the understanding that\ncar and appliance ownership would be higher among urban households\nprimarily on account of the higher purchasing power they hold [18].\nWe focus on the urban household energy consumption dynamics in\nIndian cities and demand-side factors that have the potential to influ-\nence the overall urbanization trajectory towards low-carbon consump-\ntion. More specifically, two end-use energy sectors including transport\nand buildings are selected to inspect the role of \u201cstatus\u201d perception of\nurban Indian households. The paper aims to (a) identify factors, beyond\nincome, which drive the choice of owning a car and household appli-\nances in urban Indian households; and (b) explain the role of house-hold\u2019s status in the ownership of car and electric appliances. This study\nalso comments on the limitation of existing data sources for a detailed\nevaluation of demand-side factors that drive consumption to meet car\nand appliance needs.\nOur research question focuses on the role of perceived socio-eco-\nnomic status in driving consumption. This question is of broader con-\ncern for the social sciences at large, and specifically, those investigating\nthe role of energy, involving, for example, the econometricians view in\ndiscerning not only the correlated but also tentatively causal effects,\nand involving a sociological perspective on the societal transition from\nneeds-satisfaction towards a status-driven consumption.\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section 2 brings attention to\nstatus-driven consumption for energy services in middle- and high-in-\ncome households, Section 3 presents the data and methodology to es-\ntimate the relationship between the status perceptions and car and\nappliance choices, section 4 discusses the results in varying contexts,\nand the final section presents conclusion and future research areas.\n2. Consumptionandstatus\nThe pursuit of higher status and social distinction leads to con-\nspicuous household consumption [24] and an attachment to lifestyle-\nbased status performances. Using consumption in the development,\ndisplacement and maintenance of social position was also suggested\nthrough positional goods [25] and through forms of capital and social\nexclusion [26]. However, conspicuous consumption alone says little\nabout the state of wellbeing [27]. Linssen et al. [28] find a negative\nrelationship between conspicuous consumption and subjective well-\nbeing for low income rural Indian households, while Jaikumar et al.\n[29] observe a positive relation, with a higher effect for below poverty\nline (BPL) Indian households. A similar assessment of Russian house-\nholds reveals an increase in individual happiness with increased con-\nsumption of an observable good \u2013 clothes, while the same wasinsignificant for the unobservable good \u2013 food [30].\nSocial stratification in India based on caste and gender lends het-\nerogeneity to consumption patterns and behaviours in nutrition, edu-cation, mobility and energy. This is further accentuated by western\nconsumption standards that reinforce norms around aspirational life-\nstyles. The Lok Survey from 2014 [31], found self-identified middle-\nclass households to have a highly optimistic view of their status in life\nas well as their economic futures. Consequences of this optimism could\nbe seen in choice of purchases made to meet the idea of a middle-class\nlifestyle of say owning a house, a car or adopting modern food habits.\nMarjit et al.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4924, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1179d23-4ae3-44ea-b089-02ad92b7bce7": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1179d23-4ae3-44ea-b089-02ad92b7bce7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2de0bc7-c6b7-4050-97d3-2e06a5fc1766", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a650b6d767599f6152daea2c940c825a6676bce9c5e5de4ccf8a613f90cb9ddc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e84257e7-e488-4a63-97aa-944a5716649b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "b747337703eb961a60726606bb983d64f07493bbb04fb192a6a3bef9a454c484", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A similar assessment of Russian house-\nholds reveals an increase in individual happiness with increased con-\nsumption of an observable good \u2013 clothes, while the same wasinsignificant for the unobservable good \u2013 food [30].\nSocial stratification in India based on caste and gender lends het-\nerogeneity to consumption patterns and behaviours in nutrition, edu-cation, mobility and energy.

Consequences of this optimism could\nbe seen in choice of purchases made to meet the idea of a middle-class\nlifestyle of say owning a house, a car or adopting modern food habits.\nMarjit et al. [32] test the existence of status-seeking behaviour for poor\nhouseholds in India to find that need for social status prompts poorindividuals to spend less on food and more on status goods (non-food\nitems). In associating gender roles to cooking energy use in urban India,\nKishore & Spears [33] establish a causal effect between male first child\nand use of clean cooking fuels in the household. While we may find\nstatus prevalent in daily consumption practices, not enough is under-\nstood about its extent and direction of influence on energy services in\nIndia. Status from energy consumption levels can be signalled through\nthe kinds of domestic energy practices and the modes of meeting end-\nuse energy services. For instance, installing energy-efficient lights in the\nhouse may be viewed differently to taking the bus to work daily. Lut-\nzenheiser [34] suggests basing the discourse on energy and lifestyles on\nempirical investigations, rather than recognizable and intuitively sa-\ntisfying stereotypes.\nWe therefore empirically test the hypothesis that, the probability of\na household owning a car and electric appliances increases with a\nhigher perceived status by the household.\n3. Dataandmethods\n3.1. Data\nWe use data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS)\nconducted by the University of Maryland and the National Council of\nApplied Economic Research [35,36]. The survey uses two-stage strati-\nfication and is available as a panel dataset with two rounds of data for2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312. In the second round of survey, around 83 per-\ncent of the households were re-interviewed as well as split households\n(if located within the same village or town) were added to the sample.\nThe panel dataset comprises of over 40,000 rural and urban house-\nholds. In addition, we combine the two period household data with the\ndata on Eligible Women\u2019s Profile from 2011 to 12. The data on Eligible\nWomen\u2019s Profile provides data to develop instrument variables. For this\nstudy, we restrict our sample to urban households that total around\n14,000 households.\nThe data from the IHDS was preferred over the Indian National\nSample Survey (NSS) largely as it captures the key dimension of statusthrough the question asked in round II \u2212 2012: \u2018According to you, is\nyour household poor/middle-class/comfortable?\u2019. The responses are\ncoded as Poor \u2013 1, Middle Class \u2013 2 and Comfortable \u2013 3. The survey\nalso carries data needed for constructing the instrument variables i.e.\neconomic status of husband\u2019s family for women married into the\nhousehold (detailed in Section 3.2), that is not found in other datasets.\nFurthermore, the unsuitability of the latest NSS data\n2(round 75th,\n2017\u201318), which is the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey,\nsupports the use of IHDS. Thus, despite the age of the dataset, it proves\nas the best and only source of data for the current analysis. Moreover,\nrecent publications have emerged with the use of the IHDS data, given\ntheir unique features in the Indian context [37\u201340].\nThe dependent variables for the study are the ownership of car and\n2Data withheld due to data quality concerns of the survey (https://www.\nbusiness-standard.com/article/news-ani/consumer-expenditure-survey-not-to-\nbe-released-due-to-data-quality-issues-govt-119111501572_1.html).A.

While the term \u2018comfortable\u2019 has been identified to imply a\nstatus higher than \u2018middle class\u2019 in the paper, \u2018comfortable\u2019 is less\ncommonly used in India to convey socio-economic status positions. It is\nrather used colloquially to indicate a higher/better standard of living or\nlifestyle. For this reason, many households belonging to higher-income\nquintiles may not officially state themselves as being a \u2018comfortable\u2019\nhousehold. As this question was asked only in the second round of the\nsurvey, any possible change in the perception of the household of their\nstatus over time is not possible to assess. The set of exogenous re-\ngressors selected for this study include economic factors \u2013 income\n(monthly), occupation and dwelling quality and home ownership\nstatus, demographic factors \u2013 years of education (highest education\nattainment by any adult member in the household) and number of\nmembers, social factors \u2013 membership to a social group (caste asso-\nciations, political party, panchayats, mahila mandal, religious groups,\nNGOs, rotary clubs etc), caste, religion and structural factors \u2013 location\n(living in metropolitan or metro city3). Occupation, a categorical\nvariable, is constructed using the main occupation of the father or\nhusband of the head of the household. The 6 categories adopted from\nIversen et al. [41] is created using the two-digit occupation codes from\nIHDS II and detailed in the Supplementary Data Information (SI, Table\nS1). The variable of dwelling quality, an indication of wealth, is bor-\nrowed from Rao & Ummel [37] and is constructed using five housing-\nrelated variables: roof material, wall material, floor material, toilet\ntype, and water source. Each of these dwelling characteristics is cate-\ngorised as 1-modern or 0-traditional, and index for dwelling quality is\nthe average of all binary variable multiplied by five. A completely\nmodern dwelling is indicated by an index value of five. A key standout\nof the IHDS panel dataset is the detailed information on income cap-\ntured from various sources (farming, agricultural/non-ag, business, la-\nbour, salary, remittances, government benefits4), in contrast to surveys\nsuch as the National Sample Survey (NSS) that use consumption ex-penditure or household assets to measure the income or economic level\nof the household. A detailed description of each variable and the cor-\nresponding categories is provided in the SI (Table S3). Table 1 presents\nthe summary statistics of key household demographics.\n3.2. Methods\nThe paper employs multiple regression analysis to explore the role\nof status as a demand-side dimension in household energy consump-\ntion. The variable for car ownership is taken directly as a binary cate-\ngorical variable from the survey, whereas we conduct factor analysis to\ngroup appliance ownerships with common latent characteristics into\nthree categories.

Each of\nthese variables bear multiple latent features that cannot be captured in\ntheir entirety. But if n-1 features of these 10 variables are equally\npronounced and if only one feature has opposing characteristics, then it\nis possible, by comparing the meanings of the variables, to attribute a\nconspicuous difference between the variables to the contrasting feature\nonly [42]. The units of the variables are the same and the correlation\nmatrix is used to obtain the eigenvalues of the factors. A preliminaryexploratory analysis was conducted using iterated principal factors that\nretained three factors. Varimax orthogonal rotation is then used to fa-\ncilitate the interpretation of factor loadings, that represent how the\nvariables are weighted for each factor and the correlation between the\nvariables and the factor [43]. The coefficients are used to obtain the\nfactors scores for the retained factors using the regression method.\nTable 2 presents the rotated factor loading based on factor analysis\nof household appliance ownership using principal component factors.\nAppliances for which the factor loading is above 0.35 are grouped, such\nthat the minimal level for interpretation of the structure is maintained\n[44]. Further, the appliance is placed in the group or category where its\nfactor loading is highest, as in the case for Washing Machine. Each\nfactor can be considered to represent the underlying economic pro-\ngression in the type of appliances that a household owns.

The\nresults of factor analysis are in line with the intuitive categorization of\nthe appliances.\nBased on the three appliance groups (basic, moderate, and luxur-\nious), we classify the level of ownership of the number of appliances\n(nil to maximum), from 0 to 3\n6for basic appliances, 0\u20132 for moderate\nappliances, and 0\u20135 for luxurious appliances. The determinants of\nownership are modelled separately for each appliance group, drawing\nout contextual drivers as per appliance-category type.Table1\nSummary statistics for key demographics in urban India, 2005 and 2012.\nVariable IHDS - I (2005) IHDS - II (2012)\nMean Std.

The model setup\nThe two-period data allows us to test the effect of socio-economic,\ndemographic and structural variables and for some cases the lagged\neffect of the drivers on ownership levels. The primary objective of the\npaper is to jointly study the ownership of car and appliances and the\nperception of status held by the household. However, given the sub-\njective nature of perceived status, it is likely to be motivated by un-\nobserved characteristics. When we test for the effect of status on the\nownership of car and appliances, the case becomes complicated as\nstatus being one of the explanatory factors could be endogenous. This\nmight suggest caution in interpreting the correlations as causal re-\nlationships. That is, there could be possible reverse causality with asset\nownership determining the perception status held by the household, or\nthat the status variable is correlated to the model error, or the effect of\nstatus is also explained by an omitted (confounding) variable. To cir-\ncumvent the problems posed by these possibilities, we instrument the\nperception of status with theoretically reliable and econometrically\nvalid variables \u2013 instrument variables.\nTraditional models such as multinomial logit, ordered logit, or\nnested logit models would provide inconsistent estimates in this case.\nTherefore, to simultaneously model the household car/appliance own-\nership levels and status perception, a bivariate ordered probit (BOP)\nmodel is appropriately used.\nAs the dependent (car, appliance ownership) and endogenous\n(household perception of status) variables take the form of ordered\ncategorical data, we apply the two-equation BOP model [45] using the\nfollowing functions:\n= + +Y x z i i i i 1 11'\n2 1\n(1)\n= + +Y x Y i i i i 2 11'\n1 2\n(2)\nwhere\nx' is the vector of explanatory (exogenous) variables that include\ndemographic, socio-economic and structural characteristics, \u03b2 is thevector of unknown parameters,\nY1\nis the ordered variable for status\nperception taking value from 1 to 3 and\nY2 is the ordered variable for car\nownership (binary value of 0 and 1) and for appliance ownership (value\nfrom 0 to 3 for basic appliances, 0\u20132 for moderate appliances, and 0\u20135\nfor luxurious appliances),\n1 and\n2 are normally distributed error terms,\nand subscript\ni denotes an individual observation.\n it the scalar coef-\nficient that estimates the effect that status perception has on ownership\nof car or appliance.\nThe endogeneity of\nY1 , the perception of status, implies that it could\ndepends on explanatory factor(s) in addition to those included in\nx' .\nThis endogeneity results in the correlation among the error terms in Eq.(1)\u2013 the outcome equation, and Eq. (2)\u2013 the endogenous regression.\nThis endogeneity of status perception is tested using the Durbin\u2013Wu\u2013-Hausman test [46\u201348], which rejects the null hypothesis that thehousehold\u2019s perception of status is exogenous. The likelihood ratio testsacross the two models show a simultaneous relationship between status\nand ownership levels, where status is endogenous to the ownership of\ncar or appliances at 1% level of significance. The significant test scores\nthat suggested endogeneity of\nY1\njustify the model specifications. This\nestimation process allows us to test for a causal relationship between\nperceived status and car/appliance ownership levels.\nTo address the issue of endogeneity and improve the identification\nproperties of the model, we make use of instrument variable (IV) esti-\nmation approach. A valid and reliable IV must satisfy two essential\ncriteria [49]. First, the relevance criterion requires the instrument to be\ntheoretically justified and statistically correlated (after controlling forall other exogenous variables) with the endogenous variable. Second,\nthe exogeneity criterion requires that the instrument must be un-\ncorrelated with the error terms. This criterion relies on strong theore-\ntical argumentation that eliminate a direct effect of the IV on the de-\npendent variable, or a reverse effect of the dependent variable on the\ninstruments.

Further studies for high-income [50,51] and low to middle-in-\ncome countries [52,53] have examined the expenditure on conspicuous\nconsumption and the associated consumption patterns to describe\nstatus signalling across sub-populations (rural\u2013urban, religion, race and\nethnicities etc.). The IV created for this analysis does not include ex-\npenditure made on public or private transport or household appliances\nby the household, thereby lending no direct effect on the ownership of\ncars or appliances. The IV of economic status of the husband\u2019s family\nderives significance from the traditional arranged marriages (largely\nprevalent in India) and the focus on family systems. The purpose of\nmarriages is to further the family\u2019s economic and social position. Given\nthe dominantly patriarchal structure of the society, the economic status\nof the husband\u2019s family at the time of the wedding, strongly reflects the\noverall perceived status of the household the woman is married into.\nThe absent relation between the IV and dependent variable (car or\nappliance ownership) is confirmed by a low (< 10%) Pearson\u2019s corre-\nlation coefficient.\nWe apply the two constructed instrument variables to address the\nissue of endogeneity of the status variable. The relevance of the two\ninstruments is tested in the first-stage regression by relying on the two-\nstage least square estimates. The over-identification (significant Sargan\nand Basmann chi-sq. test scores) of two IVs led to testing each of the IVs\nseparately. After controlling for all the exogenous regressors, the F \u2013\nstatistic for the IV \u2013 share of monthly expenditure on conspicuous\nconsumption is found significant and higher than 10 [49], demon-\nstrating it to be a strong instrument with high correlation to statusperception. The F-statistic was lower than 10 and insignificant for the\nIV \u2013 economic status of the husband\u2019s family. As a result, we drop the\nsecond IV. The outcome model (Eq. (2)) is finally estimated using the\nshare of monthly expenditure on conspicuous consumption as the IV for\nstatus perception.\nAs a robustness check of the chosen IV \u2013 share of monthly ex-\npenditure on conspicuous consumption, varying versions were tested by\naltering the categories for conspicuous consumptipn and scale of mea-\nsure (see SI).\nThe explanatory variables in the model satisfy the conditions for\nexogeneity such as \u0395(x\ni,\u03b5i) = 0 and \u0395(zi,\u03b5i) = 0.Table2\nFactor analysis results with factor loadings of household appliances.\nAppliances Factor 1\n(Luxurious\nAppliances)Factor 2(ModerateAppliances)Factor 3 (BasicAppliances)\nMixer/Grinder 0.23 0.32 0.39\nColour TV 0.06 0.19 0.75\nAir Cooler 0.14 0.42 0.17\nElectric Fan 0.02 0.10 0.49\nRefrigerator 0.23 0.74 0.27\nAir Conditioner 0.54 0.15 0.04\nWashing Machine 0.54 0.45 0.10\nComputer 0.50 0.25 0.09\nLaptop 0.51 0.11 0.06\nMicrowave 0.53 0.06 0.05\nNote: The factor loadings for the variables above 0.35 and considered under the\nrespective factors are marked in bold.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3489, "end_char_idx": 7476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd9e6060-8c48-42f4-9805-cb59ee8fe3e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd9e6060-8c48-42f4-9805-cb59ee8fe3e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8bf25e1-71a9-4a00-9c9f-8e9a5ed8e40e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "e987c2daca9d0724fe241100609060ace9110b611580eb978fcf453bb5678910", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cf95abf-ec5c-4845-9806-80ad7c83a479", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "886e6df90294b2f488b449a189491918a4e7d75b2f0057984943a93c670ce744", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Source: Authors\u2019 analysis based on IHDS Data 2011\u201312.\n7Variable constructed from Eligible Women\u2019s Profile 2011\u201312 dataset.A.

Resultsanddiscussion\n4.1. Appliance and car ownership variation with income\nThe evolving nature of the Indian consumer is driven by the rising\naffluence and urbanization, amongst other factors [54]. The asset ac-\nquisition across households for both rounds is illustrated in Fig. 1,\nwhich plots the relative ownership level across income quintiles (i.e.,\nthe number of households in that quintile owning an asset by the total\nnumber of households owning the asset). The income quintiles are es-\ntimated for the two rounds. The income in 2004\u201305 is inflation adjusted\nto 2011\u201312 prices, facilitating comparison across two years.\nAs incomes rise, greater shares of households own assets, con-\nforming to expectations. Of households owning a car 3.56 percent in\n2012 were in the lowest quintile, while nearly 65 percent were in the\nhighest income quintile. Similar increasing trends are also observed\nacross all appliances as well, varying by the degree of increase over the\nincome classes. The same year, a rapid increase in the share of house-\nholds owning appliances while transitioning from the fourth to fifth\nquintile is seen for \u2018capital intensive high electricity consuming appli-\nances\u2019 such as Air Conditioner, Washing Machine, Computer, Laptop,\nand Microwave. For these appliances, the income effect is found to be\nthe strongest at the highest income levels and moderate at lower and\nmiddle incomes. The trend is not as drastic for Electric Fans and Color\nTV that present only a marginal increase over income classes, as it can\nbe expected to be commonplace in urban households.\nComparative analysis is done at two levels of comparisons \u2013 first\nacross quintiles for the same year, second between the two years. The\ndata indicates interesting patterns when these household shares are\ncompared over the two survey years. Over 2004\u201305 to 2011\u201312, Q1 to\nQ3 have seen a faster increase in appliance ownership than Q4 and Q5\nacross nearly all assets. This indicates marginally higher equality (in\nappliance ownership) across income classes. As a consequence, even asmore households in the top two quintiles possess appliance in absolute\nterms in 2012, their share is now smaller. This trend suggests that the\nincrease in the number of households that owned car and appliances\nwas higher in lower- and middle-income households than in upper\nmiddle- and higher-income households. Relative to 2005, where the\nmajor share of households owning cars and appliances were in the\nhigher incomes, by 2012 this share is being shared by middle incomes\nas well. Two movements are likely to be in action here \u2013 the movements\nof households within the same income quintiles and the movements\nbetween quintiles (low to middle).\nThis expansion of the middle-income class, despite varied defini-\ntions across emerging studies, has been explored as the shifting of be-\nhaviours and spending patterns of the evolving consumer beyond cer-\ntain income levels from necessities to choice-based ones [54,55] and\nrise in self-identification as middle class for the aspirational poor [56].\nThis is also evident in the data with over 60% of urban households in\n2012 perceiving themselves as middle class. Across income quintiles\n(Fig. 2), even at the lowest income quintile, over 40% of the households\nstated themselves to be middle class. The perception of being poor fell\nand that of being comfortable increased with higher income quintiles\nfalling in line with the common base of understanding. However, across\nall income quintiles the perception of being a middle-class household\nwas dominant.\n4.2. Changing ownerships rates with status\nPlotting the category-wise appliance stock across status levels, we\nsee number of appliances (> 0) being owned under each category in-\ncreasing with improving status levels. This was the highest in case of\nBasic appliances, with 100 percent households owning at least one of\nthe appliance.

The share of households owning a car increases as the\nstatus claim change from being poor to middle class to comfortable. A\nsimilar trend is seen for appliances.\nExamining the three status perception categories independently, it\nbecomes evident that households that perceive themselves as\n\u2018Comfortable\u2019 own a larger number of appliance or have a car, as\ncompared to those who view themselves as \u2018Middle Class\u2019. Amongst\nhouseholds that were \u2018Comfortable\u2019, majority owned the Basic (100%),\nModerate (90%) and Luxurious (67%) appliances. While it is not a\nmajority, nearly 40% of Comfortable households owned a car. For the\n\u2018Middle Class\u2019 households, only 30 percent owned Luxurious appli-\nances, though a majority owned Moderate (64%) and Basic (99%) ap-\npliances. Only a share of 8% \u2018Middle Class\u2019 household owned a car.\nThus, the self-perception of socioeconomic status is positive with the\nnumber and the kind of appliance and car one owns.\n4.3. Factors explaining car and appliance ownerships\nWe estimate the BOP model jointly with Eqs. (1) and (2) using the\nmaximum likelihood method to establish a statistically significant\ncorrelation between the perception of status held by the households and\ntheir probability of ownership of a car or appliances across categories. A\npositive (negative) value of a coefficient estimate indicates an increase\n(decrease) in the probability of ownership of a car or appliances (as\napplicable). Table 3 presents the two-equation BOP model regression\nresults\n8for car ownership, and the appliance categories separately \u2013\nbasic appliances, moderate appliances and luxurious appliances. The\ntable presents the estimated coefficients of the regressors for household\nstatus perception, Eq. (1), in the top part and the estimated coefficients\nfor car and appliance category ownership, Eq. (2), in the lower part.\nAs the key focus of the paper \u2013 the effect of status perception and the\nprobability of ownership of car and appliances is revealed by gamma\n(\n), which is positive and significant across all cases. The results in-\ndicate a moderate heterogeneity in the impact of status on ownershiplevels. The effect is strongest for luxurious appliances (1.02) that in-\nclude air conditioner, washing machine, microwave, computer and\nlaptop. The increasing ownership of such appliances is indicative that\nhouseholds\u2019 desire to live affluent lifestyles marked by comfort and\nconvenience over toil and higher costs, improved service performances\n9\nas well as a visual testament of economic progress and social con-spicuousness. At the same time, the entry of microwaves and washing\nmachines into homes could free women from domestic chores, enabling\nthem to enter the workforce and contributing to the household income.\nYet for India, over 70 percent of the households surveyed are yet to own\na luxurious appliance. So as households own more of these appliances,\nthey perceive themselves as a more comfortable household relative to a\npoor or middle-class household. A gamma value of 0.92 for the impact\nof status on car ownership reiterates the value of higher status the so-\nciety accords to owning a car. The similar and significant correlation of\nstatus perception with owning basic and moderate appliances (0.87 and\n0.82 respectively), suggests that while some of these appliances are\nneeded for meeting primary living standards, households owning more\n(than one) or all appliances in the categories are perceived better-off\nthan those who own lesser.\nAnalysing the regression estimates for household perception of\n8The magnitude of the coefficients cannot be interpreted as they differ by\nscale factor.\n9Microwaves allow food to be reheated, saving cooking time; Washing\nMachines automate clothes washing tasks enabling time saving benefits and\ntransforming the washing experience; Air conditioners provide better cooling\nthan Air coolers in humid areas.A.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3574, "end_char_idx": 8173, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "868eaa3f-c95c-4e04-9d4a-1913e27922f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "868eaa3f-c95c-4e04-9d4a-1913e27922f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5af01177-cf05-45a7-b85e-3b3b7287f1d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a90bd06145b4716c9d63ed499c1c73d717e422fda3c16be3957498ca9cae8c21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a228501-c665-4a6f-bdff-0a905307c755", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/conspicuous consumption in india.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 4744596, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "995aeb96dd221b11825e02ad5466054341153dd34d2ea73ed10624c14124ee93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A gamma value of 0.92 for the impact\nof status on car ownership reiterates the value of higher status the so-\nciety accords to owning a car.

This likely indicates the middle class as-\npiration of \u2018owning\u2019 a car, while a comfortable would be more associate\nwith the car brand, quality, count or other features of a car (currently\nbeyond the scope of study).\nBarring for 1 or 2 basic appliances, the marginal effect of income\nand status on ownership is positive and significant with increasing\nnumber of appliances owned. Interestingly, the marginal effect of status\non basic and moderate appliances is higher when a household perceived\nitself as middle class than comfortable. This effect is reversed in case of\nluxurious appliances, wherein the marginal effect of a comfortable\nstatus is higher for consecutive appliance ownership relative to a\nmiddle class perception. This reiterates the strongest status effect on\nluxurious appliances as also indicated by the gamma coefficient.\nIn addition to wealth indicators, participation in social groups or\norganisation has a positive impact, while the caste category has a ne-gative influence on the perception of status. Relative to the Brahmin\ngroup (having a high social standing in the society), for households\nbelonging to forward/general categories, or Scheduled Castes,\nScheduled Tribes or Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups, the per-\nception of status falls. This impact is reflective of the inherent property\nof caste that continues to exist in India and extends to the status re-\npresentation by households [59].\nRegression estimates for car ownership reveal income and religion\nwith significant positive effects. While the positive income and car\nownership correlation is consistent with previous research and ex-\npectations, an increase in the likelihood of car ownership for house-\nholds as the religious identity of the household changes from Hindu to\nMuslim, to Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Other or No religion, is in-\nteresting. A similar correlation is seen between religion and ownership\nof all appliance categories\n11. The variations in consumption patterns\nacross religious groups was studied by Hirschman[60], concluding thatreligious affiliation may infact serve as a source of varying consumer\nbehaviour and by extension on purchase decisions. The diverserelationship between private transportation and religion in India wasalso examined by Ahmad et al. [17,61]. To additionally ascertain why\none religious group has a higher likelihood of asset purchases relative toanother, the religion\u2013asset ownership dynamics deserves a deeper in-\nvestigation, currently outside the scope of the paper.\nAcross appliance categories, income and occupation are significant\ndeterminants for basic appliances, however negatively. This could in-\ndicate that with increasing incomes and improving occupational status,\nhouseholds do not look to purchase all of the basic appliances (as ca-\ntegorised in this paper), but instead invest elsewhere. An improvement\nin the quality of dwelling increases the probability of owning moderate\nappliances, as Rao and Ummel [37] document for refrigerators in India.\nThe negative effect of owning a house on the probability of owning\nbasic appliances can be explained by the fact that when a household\npurchases a home, they are more likely to already possess the basic\nappliances such as electric fan and TV, and not purchase more. At the\nsame time, relative to a household in a non-metro, living in a metro city\nincreases the probability of a household owning basic appliances.\nThe effect of social group membership challenges prior expectations\nfor appliance ownerships. Membership of social groups or organisations\nnegatively influences moderate and luxurious appliances ownership\nlevels while increasing probability of basic appliance ownership. This\ncould mean that elements of social groups \u2013 such as which the kind of\ngroup or specific features of appliances \u2013 brands, technology, features,\nthat may influence the distinctiveness to become essential in in-\nvestigating the decision path of more expensive and conspicuous ap-\npliance purchases. This also demonstrates that as we move from pri-\nmary to more status-oriented appliances, how social identities shape\ndecisions become complex to comprehend. Subtle shifts in the social\ncontext can dramatically change the groups we identify with at any\ninstant [17,61]. The caste of the hosuehold negatively influences the\nownership of moderate and luxurious appliances.

Furthermore, industry\nand market studies foresee India to experience exponential growth inthe AC market in the next decade [65]. While urban centers serve as\nsweet spots for car manufacturers to target affluent consumers, the\nmacroeconomic and demographic trends point to shift from two- to\nfour-wheelers. Using the survey data (2015) of residents from Banga-\nlore, Delhi and Kolkata, Bansal et al. [66] predict 72% of the population\nto own cars by 2030.\nRecent studies, focussing on India and other emerging countries,\nhave explored the deep association of ownership of car and home ap-pliances with that of social status, lending support our findings. For\ninstance, Nielsen & Wilhite [67] argue that Tata Nano, a compact city\ncar manufactured and marketed by Tata Motors as inexpensive with a\nlaunch price of US$2500 in the year 2008, could not maintain sales\nvolume, primarily because of the inherent tag of a cheap car, thus\nfailing to reflect \u201cstatus\u201d. Its negative identity connotation, an adverse\nor incomplete inclusion into the new middle class, was unable to appeal\nto the masses. In another case, despite bicycle stigmatizing mobility\npractice in India, the new middle classes of Bangalore opted for high-\nend bicycles with special gears as it enabled them to maintain their\nsocial status in personal and professional circles [68]. Tracing social\nprocess in cooking practices, Wang and Bailis [69] find that the shift\naway from traditional towards modern cookstoves was led by the desire\nto disassociate with the social stigma of using old and dirty modes of\ncooking. Drawing on social practice theory, Hansen et al. [70] argued\nthat status plays one of the major roles in the dramatic increase inconsumption, for instance, demand for buildings built for air con-\nditioning as air conditioning becomes a social identifier, using India\nand Vietnam as case studies.\n5. Conclusion\nThe paper examines the patterns of car and appliance ownership\nacross income classes and tests its relationship with status perception\nusing household-level survey data. Using the instrumental variable\napproach, we establish a causal relationship between car/appliance\nownership and perception of status. As the self-perception of status held\nby the household improves the probability of the household purchasing\nor owning a car or appliance(s) increases. Specifically, after controlling\nfor income, social aspiration increases consumption of cars and appli-\nances. The results highlight the relevance of urban household\u2019s notion\nabout their relative standing in society when comparing the assets they\nown. Status emerges as a stronger factor than other non-income factors\nconsidered in the analysis.\nIn line with previous studies, household characteristics such as\nhousehold demographics, living in metros versus non-metros, house-\nhold size and housing quality factors influence car and appliance\nownerships. Importantly, we find the association with social groups \u2013\nbelonging to a caste, religion and social group membership - to sig-\nnificantly impact the ownership of car, and appliances. Over the seven-\nyear period between the surveys, the strongest increase in ownership of\ncar and luxurious appliances is seen in households from the middle-\nincome quintile (Q3), a section of which (6%) also identifies themselves\nwith being of comfortable status. Acknowledging methodological\nshortcoming, the notion of \u2018comfortable\u2019 households in the Indiancontext has been elaborated in Section 3.1. A significant share\n(40\u201350%) of low-income households (Q1-Q2) identifying themselves as\nmiddle class demonstrated that the perception of status preceded the\nactual income levels. For the emerging middle class that is not defined\nby the income alone but also by the perception and self-identification,\nstatus thus could become a key criteria for energy demand decisions:\nownership of cars and appliances seems to allow people to associate\nthemselves with a higher status relative to households with similar\nsocioeconomic characteristics but lacking these goods.\nImportantly, the instrument variable approach allowed us to de-\ntermine a direction of causality in the relationship between car/appli-\nance ownership and the perception of status held by the household.\nHouseholds that view themselves as middle class relative to being poor,\nand those that perceive themselves comfortable relative to being middle\nclass, have a higher probability of owning a car and multiple appliances\n(across all the categories).

Aspirations often act as motivations that lead\nhouseholds to strive stronger for consumer goods that may not be im-\nmediately affordable but would be desirable in the future. This steady\naspiration can change spending patterns of the new Indian consumer\ntowards goods that provide a higher status value (conspicuously) but\nwith fewer functional and practical utility. The increasing affordability\nof aspirational goods may pivot the needs of even value-conscious\nIndian consumers. Furthermore, the shifting of family structures \u2013 joint\nfamilies giving way to nuclear households \u2013 has seen a corresponding\nshift in basing consumption decisions on lifestyle considerations and\nthe need to \u2018keep pace\u2019 [54]. The social nature of consumption stimu-\nlated by online shopping and social media exposures add to this pace.While concerns remain on characterising a comfortable lifestyle that is\nalso a low-carbon one, status-based consumption in the emerging\ncountry context demand deeper investigation. This calls for a renewed\nfocus on status signalling in consumption research while also enabling\nfuture household surveys to capture a higher resolution on facets of\nsocial status and its interaction, in particular, with the use of energy\nservices.\nConsumption patterns tend to change ahead of incomes [71]. In\nlight of urbanization, social mobility and rising affluence, the self-\nidentified middle-class households with their aspirational standards of\nliving emerge as the potentially largest consumers market. These find-\nings move in the direction of identifying role of social factors in car and\nappliance uptake and can inform designing demand-side solutions to\nslowing residential energy demand and lifestyle contributions to cli-\nmate change mitigation.\nDeclarationofCompetingInterest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influ-\nence the work reported in this paper.\nAcknowledgements\nAuthors are thankful to Barbora Sedova for her help with the IHDS\ndata.

But Indian cuisine, like Chinese cuisine, is\nabout as far from homogenous as you can get. Kashmiri cooking is di\u0000erent from Keralan cooking, both are di\u0000erent\nfrom what you might \ufb01nd in Kolkata in Bengal, and so it goes. So saying that a lightly sweet Gewurztraminer is ideal\nwith Indian food is about as nonsensical as saying, \"Chardonnay goes great with American food.\"\nAt the acclaimed restaurant Babu Ji in New York's East Village (where I had the best Indian meal I've had in ages),\nchef Jessi Singh and wine consultant Jorge de Yarza (who has his own superb Basque place, Donostia, a few blocks\naway) have thought a lot about this. As Singh says, \"I try to feature the whole of India on my menu. One dish from\nthe west, a couple from the south, a couple from the north, a few from the east.\" Singh's Gol Gappa, a hollow,\ncrackling-crisp ball of poori bread, \ufb01lled with tamarind chutney, yogurt and spices is indicative of his cooking.\nEating it\u2014you pop it in your mouth in one bite\u2014is like having a \ufb02avor-pi\u00f1ata explode on your tongue. \"If you want to\ngive someone a crash course in Indian cuisine, you give them this,\" Singh says. \"It's a street snack, and comes from\nUpper Pradesh. Whenever anyone in my family dies we take their ashes to this one town in Upper Pradesh. The\npriests keep a ledger of the family\u2014our ledger goes back 800 years. This town's tradition is to make their gol gappa\nwith yogurt. It's so nice\u2014creamy, crunchy, sweet, spicy, sour.\"\nThis is a dish that a lightly sweet wine actually works with. De Yarza says, \"With the gol gappa you get that citrusy,\nminty, yogurt, sweet-spice mix. The Theo Minges Kabinett Riesling that we have on the list almost tastes like a\ndeconstructed margarita. It's a fun combo with those snack food \ufb02avors.\"\nSingh's Punjabi Kadhi, a dish of cauli\ufb02ower fritters in a tangy, turmeric-in\ufb02ected yogurt curry, has an entirely\ndi\u0000erent \ufb02avor pro\ufb01le. \"Kadhi is a staple dish of my home. We had ten bu\u0000alos, so we'd make our own yogurt, and\nmy mom would take the yogurt and keep it three or four days to let it get more sour. You add some lemon juice, add\nturmeric and chickpea \ufb02our, and cook it for seven or eight hours.\"\nFor the Kadhi, Yarza pours a Chardonnay from France's Jura region. \"The kadhi has a beautiful sourness, so it needs\nmore weight,\" he says. \"A structured, savory white is ideal.\"\nSingh enjoys the way his menu darts all over the Indian subcontinent: \"I love Chinese-Indian cuisine\u2014Chinese\nrefugees in Calcutta created it over 100 years ago. I always have two or three things that represent that tradition, like\nChinese noodles with Indian spice, or Mumbai spring rolls, with green mango, carrots and shredded meat.

While the external environment continued to present challenges in some markets, the fundamentals of our strategy remain sound, with strong demand in the luxury wine segment driving progress towards our ambition of being the world\u2019s most admired premium wine company.  \nDear shareholders, \nWe are pleased to present the 2023 Annual Report for Treasury Wine \nEstates Limited. \nThis has been a year of continued profit and EBITS margin growth \ndespite difficult global economic and geo-political circumstances. \nWhile the challenging environment has continued the trend of recent \nyears, our clear strategy, diversified business model and disciplined \nexecution has seen our iconic brands continue to grow in key markets \nin Asia (excluding Mainland China), the Americas, Australia, Europe, \nand further afield. \nGuided by our TWE2025 strategy while being agile and proactive \nin responding to shifts in the external environment, we continue \nto leverage the opportunities before us. Our activity this year has \nfocused on investment behind our priority brands and innovation \nagenda, expanding our multi-country of origin portfolios, optimising \nour global asset footprint, and making organisational change that allows us to improve our efficiency. The re-allocation of investment  \nto where it will best support growth in the current and future \ncommercial environment has, and will continue to, deliver cost\n  \nand structural benefits.\nWith our brand portfolio operating model now firmly in place, we\u2019ve\n \nseen a clear focus on execution from each division: Penfolds, Treasury \nPremium Brands, and Treasury Americas. The premiumisation trend has continued across all our markets, informing our approach to \nattracting new consumers into the category and expanding the occasions that our portfolio satisfies for existing ones. \nPenfolds has cemented its position as a global luxury icon, continuing \nthe tradition of engaging wine lovers and new consumers in \ninnovative ways: from premium after-sales experiences including wine certification through re-corking clinics to Penfolds House events \naround the world that bring together the best of wine, music, and design. Underpinning the brand\u2019s appeal in established and emerging \nmarkets is the focus on quality; the renowned Penfolds House Style.  \nA new tier in the Penfolds range \u2013 \u2018One by Penfolds\u2019 \u2013 was launched \nin September 2022 as a dynamic way of engaging the \u2018new luxurian\u2019\n \nconsumer with wines from the US, France, and for the first time - China. One by Penfolds leverages the brand as a hallmark for heritage, and \nrealises our long-held ambition to make wine in China. The China red blend, featuring grapes from the Ningxia region of China, is now \navailable alongside the US and French wines after the Hong Kong \nlaunch in early F24.  \nEnhancing production capacity to satisfy growing global demand for Penfolds informed our acquisition of a majority stake in the historic\n \nCh\u00e2teau Lanessan in Bordeaux, France, which completed in F23. The acquisition has doubled the production capacity for French-sourced \nPenfolds, and we have been collaborating closely with the Ch\u00e2teau\u2019s \nwinemakers and the Bouteiller family, which retains a minority stake. \nPlans are underway for the transformation of the historic site, founded \nin the late 18th century, into a cohesive blend of Penfolds storied \nhistory of almost 180 years and the brand\u2019s future focus in Europe, in \nthe heart of France\u2019s premier winemaking region. \nWith the increasing consumer interest in lighter red wines, we also \ncompleted the acquisition of Beenak Vineyard in Victoria\u2019s Yarra \nValley, which has significant plantings of cool-climate varieties \nincluding Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. We also made the difficult \ndecision to close the Karadoc commercial winery in Victoria, Australia, \nin F24. Wines made at the Karadoc site will continue to be produced \nlocally through third party partnerships, allowing us to continue to \nfocus our capital  investment into premium and luxury winemaking.  \nThis year, Treasury Premium Brands has grown demand across \nAsia, in particular south-east Asia, with priority brands Pepperjack, \nSquealing Pig, 19 Crimes, and Rawson\u2019s Retreat strengthening consumer engagement.

Our share price has risen, despite the loss of the majority of the China business, more than 250% from $3.30 on listing to $11.70 at the time of writing.\nThis growth is a reflection of a much stronger, more collaborative \nglobal management team, a more robust portfolio of brands focused on the premium and luxury end of the market, a more efficient and diversified global vineyard and winemaking footprint, and stronger market positions in most markets around the world.\nThere are a number people who\u2019ve enabled this growth that I would \nlike to thank. Firstly, my fellow Non-Executive Directors, past and present, who without exception have played a major role in these achievements. I\u2019d also like to thank the three Chief Executive Officers that TWE has had since its inception: David Dearie, who launched the company with a bold vision, and then Mike Clarke, who transformed the company into a far more efficient and stronger operation, as well as leaving an excellent successor in the current CEO, Tim Ford. Tim has taken the business up another level, despite the headwinds of the COVID pandemic and Chinese government decision to impose tariffs on Australia-sourced wine in China. I firmly believe that as a result of the steps Tim and his management team have taken to diversify our sources of production and markets following this decision, the company is now in a far better position for long-term growth.\nApart from the individuals listed above, I\u2019d like to acknowledge many \nothers I\u2019ve worked with, who have contributed to TWE\u2019s growth.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4787, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76dc7c3e-53a6-4d48-9c37-71e34fea2636": {"__data__": {"id_": "76dc7c3e-53a6-4d48-9c37-71e34fea2636", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1357693-3431-4477-9837-1fc045178f25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "291bdfb73f6cb34a3fac4d17283bd026e430b0187e1430649a96091667262d4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "664b1cb0-16be-457f-a211-c1ae643368f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "edf89ac2cab878e81cade2951485269ddb2e73eebd543d681f06b0ad146bd017", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I\u2019d also like to thank the three Chief Executive Officers that TWE has had since its inception: David Dearie, who launched the company with a bold vision, and then Mike Clarke, who transformed the company into a far more efficient and stronger operation, as well as leaving an excellent successor in the current CEO, Tim Ford.

The misalignment of supply can lead to shortage, which in turn can limit growth and revenue potential. Alternatively, misalignment can generate excess supply that needs resolution through supply sales, asset re-alignment and/or reallocation of wine. \nAs a result, our ability to \nmanage COGS, grow revenue and achieve EBITS targets could be affected, both in the year of harvest and in future periods.\u2022 Multi-regional growing and sourcing. \n\u2022 Balanced grape intake between owned/leased vineyards and third-party suppliers. \n\u2022 Long-term vintage planning and ongoing demand planning processes, to align our \nsupply with our insights from monitoring changing consumer preferences. \n\u2022 Strong grower relationships and defined service level agreements. \n\u2022 Ongoing customer/distributor relationship management to understand changes in demand and achieve alignment with our current and future portfolio of products. \n\u2022\n Innovative agronomic practices to improve vineyard yield. \n\u2022 Global wine allocation process for constrained products to maximise value from products where supply is unable to meet demand.\nPartner \nperformance and market concentrationTWE\u2019s ability to achieve \nour objectives is directly tied to the performance of our partners (suppliers, distributors, and retailers).

Strong NSR growth of 14.3% was delivered through Asia, Australia and EMEA, reflecting the continued momentum behind the Penfolds strategy to build distribution and grow consumer demand. In addition, the successful launch of One by Penfolds and growth of the multi-country of origin portfolios contributed to NSR growth, particularly in Asia.

Strong performance of key luxury brands including Frank Family Vineyards and Beaulieu Vineyard, the continued growth of Matua, and favourable foreign exchange rates were partly offset by shipment declines for 19 Crimes and Sterling Vineyards in addition to constrained luxury portfolio availability from the lower yielding 2020 Californian vintage.

Today, this philosophy extends beyond Australia, as Penfolds explores the bountiful soils of California, Napa Valley, Bordeaux, and China.\nBringing two hemispheres together with  a partnership between Penfolds and Dourthe \nThis partnership between Penfolds and one of Bordeaux\u2019s most \nrespected winemaking groups, Dourthe, was born from a shared \ndesire of two winemakers to express quality through a harmonious \nblend of traditional French winemaking techniques and time-honoured Australian winemaking methods. Combining the creativity, \ndirection and vision of Penfolds Chief Winemaker Peter Gago and \nDourthe Chief Winemaker Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonnaffous, the two houses \ncollaborated to craft a wine that spans Northern and Southern \nHemispheres, blending grapes from Bordeaux (71%) and South \nAustralia (29%). Made from the 2019 vintage, the final wine was \nblended and bottled in South Australia by Penfolds winemakers \u2013 and released as part of The Penfolds Collection 2022.\nExcellence in Chardonnay with Penfolds V\nIn February 2023, Penfolds unveiled its first multi-vintage Chardonnay \n\u2013 Penfolds V.

Penfolds Yattarna was first released in 1995 after 144 \nwinemaking trials. A wine of meticulous refinement, generations of \nPenfolds winemakers inspired the creation of this white wine that went \non to earn a reputation as one of Australia\u2019s finest. Today, we see \nthe patience, courage, and evolution of Penfolds white winemaking \nendeavours personified in this new multi-vintage blend.\nOne By Penfolds \nIn September 2022, Penfolds announced a new range of wines made \nin France, America and China under a new tier: One by Penfolds. \nLaunched in China as a prelude to the global launch in mid-2023, \nthe first release included four wines from France, America and China, \nexpanding on Penfolds multi-country of origin approach.

This experience reinforced our leadership attributes and was an opportunity for leaders to practice creating a greater sense of belonging \nand develop a deeper appreciation of the role of connection \nin building an inclusive culture.  \n\u2022\n To build future leaders, Empower Me, TWE\u2019s development \nprogram for females and non-binary employees, was \nexpanded to include new and emerging leaders from \nunder-represented groups across the business. During 2023 \na total of 30 employees were enrolled in the program and are encouraged to take leadership roles within Employee \nResource Groups (ERGs) and represent TWE publicly.\nEngaged employees, consumers and communities\n\u2022\n To position IE&D within Supply in Australia as business critical\n \nand an intrinsic part of our Employee Value Proposition, as well as encouraging the involvement of Supply employees, a Supply \nIE&D governance structure was established. This structure is led by the Chief Supply Officer and members of the Supply \nLeadership Team, who review and support plans to build \nengagement. For example, members of the Supply Leadership \nTeam led an ERG roadshow, visiting all Supply sites and providing \neducation sessions to show how IE&D is relevant to all employees \nirrespective of location, and how ERGs can support employees \nto feel a sense of belonging. In the US, IE&D and the ERG topics \nhave been included in front line supervisory training for new and \ndeveloping front line leaders.  44.5%\n0.4% DECREASE\n42.8%\n1.3% INCREASEFemales in  \nleadership roles\nFemales in  \nall rolesF23 progress on diversity targets Our commitment to inclusion,  \nequity and diversity\nF23 progress towards the IE&D Strategy\nThe Company\u2019s IE&D plan is built on the foundations established in \nrecent years and focuses on IE&D being leader-led, integrated into the way that we work and inclusive of all employees.

This is essential for the long-term performance and sustainability of the Company and to protect the interests of its stakeholders.\nTo this end, the Board regularly reviews the charters and key policies \nthat underpin the Company\u2019s corporate governance practices to ensure they remain appropriate, reflect high standards of governance and meet regulatory requirements.

The Board utilises a skills matrix to assist in assessing the mix of skills, experience and diversity on the Board, and to identify areas of focus to supplement the mix of skills and experience as part of Board succession planning. Each Director annually rates their skills, expertise and experience from 1 to 3 for each competency identified in the Board skills matrix (1 = working knowledge, 2 = good understanding, and 3 = expert). The self-assessment ratings are subsequently calibrated and included in the Board skills matrix.\nThe Board considers that its members collectively possess the \nappropriate competencies and attributes that enable the Board to discharge its responsibilities effectively, contribute to the Company\u2019s strategic direction and oversee the delivery of its corporate objectives. \nThe Company\u2019s Game Plan is set out in Table 1.

The remuneration report is designed to demonstrate strong \nalignment between our Company\u2019s performance, our executive \nreward framework, our strategic objectives and shareholder interests.\nThis is my first letter to Shareholders as the Chair of the Human \nResources Committee. I would like to acknowledge Warwick  \nEvery-Burns\u2019 contribution to the Board and leadership of the Human \nResources Committee from May 2011 to October 2022.\nF23 performance\nWe are very pleased with the overall momentum of the business\n \nand the progress toward delivering our long term strategies under our CEO Tim Ford\u2019s leadership. Despite challenging economic and \ntrading conditions globally, all divisions continued to build quality \ndistribution, expand in key markets, and drive consumer demand. \nThe management team demonstrated exceptional leadership, \nresilience, agility and tenacity, consistently turning challenges into \nopportunities while positioning the Company for future growth. \nNotably, the team\u2019s continued efforts to premiumise our business have paid off, with 85% of our revenues now coming from our premium and luxury portfolios.\nIn F23, Management delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase \non the prior year, and EBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points \nto 24.1%. Net Sales Revenue (NSR) per case increased 12.7% led by \npremiumisation and price rises delivered across all divisions. TWE \ndelivered Earnings per Share (EPS) of 52.1 cents per share (before \nmaterial items and SGARA), up 16.6% from F22. ROCE increased from\n10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued \ncapital discipline.\nWith a solid foundation in place, we have great confidence in the \nambition, strategy and executional discipline of our leadership team \nthat will enable TWE to deliver sustainable growth and outperform the market over the long term.\nF23 executive remuneration outcomes \nIn F23, all executives received a 3% increase to fixed remuneration. \nThe Board also approved a 3% increase to Board Chair and Member \nbase fees and a moderate increase to Committee fees effective from 1 July 2022. Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) outcomes reflect \nthe level of business performance and range between 35%-72% of \nfixed remuneration, and 30%-40% of maximum opportunity. The F21 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) had an adjusted vesting of 78.75% of \nthe total target grant value.\nIn 2022 and 2023, I participated in numerous meetings with investors \n(representing over 60% of capital) and proxy advisors to discuss \nwhether our programs were fit for purpose and working as intended, \nparticularly in light of several material, one-off events entirely", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36223328-de31-480f-a9bb-b622f5e07a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "36223328-de31-480f-a9bb-b622f5e07a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50f0e3cc-3512-4aed-8319-096f44cfb6a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a26f3baa60c087546015809ccaf47da110570e6454590a00487cf2934b578257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43dd29ac-583d-43fe-b486-4212c765ddb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0c879acffb26e2448c4bdddb6400a70f0173895de35f99f0e05ed750a9403ca1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "59\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\noutside of management\u2019s control that materially impacted financial \nresults. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, \nand wildfires in California which reduced our access to luxury supply, \nthe imposition of tariffs on Australian wine in 2020 effectively closed \nthe China market \u2013 our largest and most profitable market at the time - overnight. In the face of these extraordinary events, executives were once again tasked in F23 with aggressive stretch goals to \npivot the business and mitigate impacts by driving growth in other markets and focusing on delivering quality growth in earnings. \nDespite their tremendous successes in F23 and over the past three \nyears, it has proven virtually impossible to achieve alignment \nbetween pay, TWE\u2019s strategic objectives, financial performance \nand shareholder returns. Outcomes for our executives - and for our \nshareholders - have not reflected alignment with what we believe to \nbe outstanding performance by our team. The cumulative impact \nof these external headwinds directly resulted in no STIP payments for \nF20, and nil vesting of the LTIP for three straight years in a row (2020, \n2021 and 2022). \nWhile we believe that STIP outcomes in F23 appropriately reward \nour executives,  the impacts of these events have once again \nimpacted both the relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) and \nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE) measures in the F21 LTIP, \nresulting in a significantly reduced rTSR payout and what would \notherwise be a fourth year of a nil payout on ROCE. I was very encouraged to hear once again during our investor meetings \nin 2023 that our shareholders overwhelmingly agreed with our \nassessment regarding the team\u2019s performance, and also agreed \nthat a compelling rationale warranted action by the Board to reward \nperformance and remedy the otherwise inequitable outcome under \nthe existing plan in place.\nPrincipled approach to adjusting the ROCE outcome in the F21 LTIP\nAs outlined in this report, after careful consideration of numerous \nalternatives and factors, extensive consultation throughout this \nprocess with our independent consultant, and in light of the \ncompelling results and the imperative to retain and motivate our \nleadership team, the Board made the unanimous decision to adjust \nonly the ROCE outcome (and not rTSR), and moreover, to adjust \nthe ROCE outcome only for the direct impact of the imposition of \nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) tariffs (and to exclude the other material, unanticipated events including the pandemic and \nwildfires). The resulting payouts are at 39% for the rTSR component \n(unadjusted and weighted at 25%) and 92% for the ROCE component (as adjusted for the MOFCOM tariffs only and weighted at 75%), with \ntotal vesting of the F21 LTIP at 78.75% of the target grant value.  \nFirst off, we determined that the F21 LTIP was the appropriate vehicle, \ngiven this plan includes the entire leadership team in place who\n \nwere tasked in F22 and F23 with aggressive stretch goals to pivot the business and mitigate these impacts. Moreover, the F21 LTIP is the final plan which did not account for the MOFCOM tariffs. While a \ncompelling rationale existed to adjust for other material, unforeseen events outside the control of management, we ultimately decided \nto focus exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs, with an eye toward both \nacknowledging the impacts on our investors as well as balancing \nthe interests and outcomes of all stakeholders. In addition, focusing exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs in our analysis enabled us to \nundertake a robust, objective, and comprehensive evaluation of the \ndirect impacts of the tariffs since 2020 as well as the direct results of aggressive mitigation strategies. Finally, we strongly believe that this award has been earned by the team.\nRest assured, this decision was not taken lightly. The circumstances \nsurrounding these events and the direct impact the tariffs had on \nthe performance of the Company were carefully considered over the course of many months, as well as the impact on shareholder \nreturns. As opposed to merely \u2018balancing\u2019 executives\u2019 and \nshareholders\u2019 interests, we strongly believe that the decisions we \nhave taken directly align the best interests of our executives and \nshareholders alike.  After much deliberation, the Board and Human \nResources Committee unanimously concluded that this was simply \nthe right thing to do - for all of our stakeholders.\nF23 activities of the Human Resources Committee \nDuring the year, we developed and formalised TWE\u2019s Executive Remuneration Framework and Strategy and also focused on remuneration policies and initiatives throughout the organisation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4736, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43dd29ac-583d-43fe-b486-4212c765ddb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "43dd29ac-583d-43fe-b486-4212c765ddb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50f0e3cc-3512-4aed-8319-096f44cfb6a5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "a26f3baa60c087546015809ccaf47da110570e6454590a00487cf2934b578257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36223328-de31-480f-a9bb-b622f5e07a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "8733381bffb3f0279d6ed67630ab8a266d7336390d11f37f22fde249f61bfc2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Finally, we strongly believe that this award has been earned by the team.\nRest assured, this decision was not taken lightly.

The premiumisation trends \ncontinue across the wine category with luxury wine continuing \nstrong growth trends in all of TWE\u2019s key global markets. Management \nexecuted strongly during the year and our diversified business model, \ntogether with the benefits of key asset base and cost optimisation \ninitiatives, have resulted in a resilient premium wine category despite \nthe tightening economic environment. \nIn F23, Management delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase \non the prior year, and EBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points \nto 24.1%. Net Sales Revenue (NSR) per case increased 12.7% led by \npremiumisation and price rises delivered across all divisions.  \nTWE delivered Earnings per Share (EPS) of 52.1 cents per share (before \nmaterial items and SGARA), up 16.6% from F22. ROCE increased from\n \n10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued capital \ndiscipline.\nDespite continued supply chain and cost headwinds, and changing \nconsumer and market dynamics, consumer demand for luxury wine \nremains strong in all markets globally, with luxury sales in the Penfolds, \nTreasury Americas and Treasury Premium Brands divisions in line \nwith expectations. Penfolds, in particular, continues to deliver strong \nmomentum in building distribution and consumer demand across a number of key global markets.Current KMP\nTM Ford Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Full Year\nMJ Young Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Full Year\nSR Boxer Chief Strategy and Corporate \nDevelopment Officer (CSCDO)Full Yearb) Fixed remuneration\nTWE\u2019s global platform continues to experience significant growth, \nincreasing the responsibility and complexity of executive roles. \nMoreover, the executive team has been crucial to ensuring the \nsuccessful navigation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the tariffs \nimposed on Australian wine by MOFCOM.

Despite continued supply chain and cost headwinds, and changing consumer and market dynamics,  the Company has achieved solid \nperformance against the F23 STIP targets. The continued focus on \nluxury wine and premiumisation has enabled strong EBITS and EBITS \nmargin growth, despite a decline in NSR driven by premium portfolio \nvolume declines in Treasury Americas and commercial portfolio volume declines in Treasury Premium Brands, partly offset by strong \nluxury portfolio growth for Penfolds. \nThe market trends and consumption outlook for commercial wine, \nhowever, remains challenged, most notably in Australia and the UK. \nIn recent years, this has led to further declines in Treasury Premium \nBrands\u2019 lower margin commercial portfolio volumes, a market \ndynamic that is expected to continue in the future.

The Group\u2019s rTSR performance was at the 51st percentile of its peer group, driving an unadjusted outcome of 39% \nvesting for this component of the LTIP (weighted at 25%). \nWith respect to ROCE performance, however, and despite \nmanagement\u2019s successes in pivoting the business and driving \nsustainable earnings, aggressive cost management and operational \neffectiveness, the impacts of the pandemic, the wildfires in the US and \nthe introduction of the MOFCOM tariffs, without otherwise adjusting \nfor any of these factors, resulted in the ROCE component falling once \nagain below threshold.\nGiven the clear disconnect between the underlying assumptions \nmade when targets were originally set in 2020 and what thereafter \ntranspired (ie the COVID pandemic, wildfires and imposition of \nMOFCOM tariffs in China), the Committee and Board ultimately \nconcluded that a clear and compelling rationale existed to warrant \nan adjustment to the ROCE outcome to ensure that the intent and \nintegrity of the plan was maintained. \nThe Committee and Board has undertaken a comprehensive analysis \nof a number of identified principles which we believe were pertinent \nto our analysis, including: (a) whether the intent and integrity of the plan, while ensuring fair outcomes for Management, could be \nmaintained; (b) whether external business and economic factors beyond the control of Management which have materially impacted performance have occurred; (c) whether unforeseen, non-recurring factors occurred during the performance period which have materially impacted performance; (d) management\u2019s efforts and results to mitigate the impacts of the factors outlined above; (e) the \nlonger-term, sustainable impact of decisions and actions made by \nmanagement in the short-term; (f) whether budgetary assumptions made when setting performance targets were accurate and remain \nappropriate, and whether conditions are potentially better or worse \nwhen compared with those assumptions; (g) the degree of difficulty \nand complexity associated with achieving the targets, as related to \nboth the internal and external environment; and (h) alignment with \nthe interest of shareholders. \nWhile a compelling rationale existed to adjust for other material, \nunforeseen events outside the control of management, the \nCommittee and Board ultimately decided to focus exclusively on the \nMOFCOM tariffs and the success of mitigation initiatives, with an eye \ntoward both acknowledging the impacts on our investors as well as \nbalancing the interests and outcomes of all stakeholders. In addition, focusing exclusively on the MOFCOM tariffs enabled us to undertake \na robust and objective  evaluation of the direct impacts of the tariffs \nsince 2020 as well as the direct results of aggressive mitigation strategies. \nThe unanticipated introduction of the MOFCOM tariffs clearly \nconstitutes an external business and economic factor beyond the control of management which materially impacted performance. \nMoreover, this event was unforeseen and non-recurring in nature, and budgetary assumptions made when setting performance targets \nwere no longer rendered accurate or appropriate. Management, has \nbeen highly successful in aggressively mitigating these impacts by \nexecuting both near term strategies as well as sustainable, strategic \ninitiatives for the longer term. Given that budgetary assumptions \nmade when setting targets proved to be inaccurate, the intent \nand integrity of the F21 LTIP was clearly compromised such that fair outcomes could not be achieved without an adjustment. Moreover, \nthe results achieved in the face of multiple obstacles highlight the strength and resilience of our global business and management\u2019s \nability to navigate the complex and changing economic, consumer and market dynamics with agility and tenacity. Finally, the Committee and Board strongly believe that the intent and integrity of the plan could not otherwise be maintained, and that this award has been earned by the team.\nOver the course of many months, the Committee continued to \nseek advice and guidance from our independent remuneration \nadvisors, PwC, on the relevant considerations and factors as well \nas the potential approaches and alternatives.

Remuneration strategy and framework\na) Remuneration strategy\nTWE\u2019s remuneration strategy sets the direction for the remuneration framework and drives the design and application of remuneration programs across the Company, including for executives. The strategy aims to attract, retain and reward the best talent while building a performance-oriented culture. It sets out principles and processes to ensure remuneration practices attract and motivate the highest calibre employees to achieve TWE\u2019s business and financial objectives.\nThe remuneration strategy is designed to achieve five key objectives.\n1.\n Attract, motivate and retain the highest calibre executives.\n \n2.\n Provide incentives and rewards that drive both our short and\n \nlong-term strategic objectives. \n3.\n Directly align the interests and outcomes of our executives with\n \nour shareholders.\n4.\n Create a performance-driven culture.\n5.\n Deliver results that reinforce our culture and are sustainable\n \nover the long-term. The Board believes that remuneration of executives should include a\u00a0fixed component and at-risk or performance-related components, including both short-term and long-term incentives. Executive and stakeholder interests are aligned through share ownership. The weighting of the at-risk remuneration components for each executive reflects the Board\u2019s commitment to performance-based reward. Section 3 of this report describes performance outcomes over the past five years, and how they have impacted remuneration outcomes.\nb) Remuneration framework\nAttract, motivate and \nretain the highest calibre executivesDrive both our short and long-term strategic objectivesAlign the interests and outcomes of our executives with our shareholdersCreate a performance-driven cultureDeliver results that reinforce our culture and are sustainable over the long-term\nComponents Performance measures DetailsRemuneration frameworkRemuneration strategy", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4177, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1558ce87-c78a-458f-8b2a-748c83d4bf9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1558ce87-c78a-458f-8b2a-748c83d4bf9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75bf46a2-4dd9-4395-b8b1-5cb53a17d628", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "87f592907292997baa5612395296281f435135dd1d3b066a389d1fd3f666d8c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "64\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\nThe LTIP is designed to reward executives \nfor long-term performance and value creation for shareholders.\nIt is delivered in the form of Performance \nRights that vest at the end of the performance period if the performance and vesting conditions are met.

Performance and remuneration outcomes\na) Overview of Company performance\nCompany performance during F23 saw earnings and margin growth, driven by strong luxury top-line growth from Penfolds, successful price increases across several brands and cost savings from the global supply chain optimisation program. The premiumisation trends continue across the wine category with luxury wine continuing strong growth trends in all of TWE\u2019s key global markets.  Management executed strongly during the year and our diversified business model, together with the benefits of key asset base and cost optimisation initiatives, have resulted in a resilient premium wine category despite the tightening economic environment. \nTWE delivered EBITS of $583.5m, an 11.4% increase on prior year and \nEBITS margin improved 2.9 percentage points to 24.1%. We delivered EPS of 52.1 cents per share (before material items and SGARA) while ROCE increased from 10.7% in F22 to 11.3% in F23, driven by higher EBITS and continued capital allocation discipline. The Company\u2019s capital structure remains flexible and efficient. We have retained a strong balance sheet and investment grade capital structure, with net  \ndebt/EBITDAS of 1.9x .\nDue to the outstanding performance from our executives and our\n \nglobal teams and execution of key strategic priorities, the Company \ndelivered strong operating momentum in F23. Penfolds reported a 14.2% increase in EBITS and NSR growth of 14.3% was delivered through Asia, Australia and EMEA, reflecting the continued momentum behind the Penfolds strategy to build distribution and grow consumer demand. Treasury Americas reported a 14.0% increase in EBITS and EBITS margin increased by 5.6 percentage points, led by strong performance of key luxury brands including Frank Family Vineyards and Beaulieu Vineyard and continued growth of premium brands, including Matua. This was partly offset by declines for 19 Crimes and Sterling Vineyards in addition to constrained luxury portfolio availability from the lower yielding 2020 Californian vintage. Treasury Premium Brands reported a 5.4% decline in EBITS while EBITS margin was in line with F22. Reduced NSR for the commercial portfolio in the UK and Australia were partly offset by 7.8% NSR growth for priority premium brands including 19 Crimes, Squealing Pig and Pepperjack. The combined premium and luxury portfolios delivered high  \ndouble-digit gross profit growth in F23. \nThe table below summarises the Company\u2019s financial performance\n \nover the last five financial years.\nTable 3.1: Overview of Company performance (reported)\nFinancial year ended 30 June 2023\nEBITS performance (A$ million) 664.7 512.6 510.3 523.7 583.5\nEarnings per share (cents)257.2 41.7 43.0 44.7 52.1\nDividends paid per share (cents) 35 40 23 28 343\nFranked (%) 100 100 100 100 100\nClosing share price ($ at 30 June) 14.92 10.48 11.68 11.35 11.23\nReturn on capital employed (%) 13.6 10.2 10.8 10.7 11.320191202012021 2022\n2023\n1.

In addition to its remuneration responsibilities and together with the Board, the  \nHRC\u2019s duties include overseeing talent management, inclusion, equity and diversity, culture, and leadership development.\nThe Committee ensures that the Company\u2019s policies and frameworks\n \naid the achievement of the Company\u2019s strategic objectives, provide \nappropriate governance, are aligned with market practice, and fulfil the Board\u2019s responsibility to shareholders. During the year the Audit and Risk Committee Chair attended all but one of the Human Resources Committee meetings as a Committee member. Also, the Human Resources Committee Chair typically attends the Audit and Risk Committee meetings, providing a link between both Committees to assist with oversight of non-financial risk.\nAs outlined in Section 4 of the Corporate Governance Statement \ndisclosed on the Company\u2019s website tweglobal.com, the Company has procedures in place for the reporting of any matter that may give rise to a conflict between the interests of a Director and those of the Company.  In addition, the Company has adopted a general policy for employees in relation to the disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest (see Section 4 of the Corporate Governance Statement on tweglobal.com).b)  Engagement of remuneration advisorsIn F23, the Board and HRC engaged PwC as an independent advisor to the HRC. Potential conflicts of interest are considered by the HRC, and the Board and HRC are satisfied that the advice provided by PwC was free from undue influence. Any advice provided by remuneration consultants is used as a guide only and is not a substitute for detailed consideration of all relevant issues by the HRC. No remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), were provided. \nc)  Executive and Non-Executive Director share ownership\nExecutives and Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to have control over ordinary shares in the Company and executives and  \nNon-Executive Directors are required to hold at least the equivalent of one year\u2019s fixed remuneration or base fees. The guidelines are\n \nexpected to be met over a reasonable period of time (approximately five years).

Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. \nBasis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) adopted by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidated financial statements comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the International Accounting Standards Boards (IASB).

A list of controlled entities (subsidiaries) is provided in note 28.\nAn entity is regarded as a controlled entity when the Company is \nexposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity.  \nThe rights of other investors to the results and equity of the subsidiaries (called non-controlling interests) are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and  \nother comprehensive income, consolidated statement of  \nchanges in equity and consolidated statement of financial  position respectively.\nThe financial information of the subsidiaries is prepared for the \nsame reporting period as the parent, using consistent accounting policies.  Intra-group balances and transactions arising from  \nintra-group transactions are eliminated.\n \nA change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of \ncontrol, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\nFunctional and presentation currency\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. The major functional currencies used throughout the Group include Australian Dollar (AUD), United States Dollar (USD) and Great British Pound (GBP). Other currencies used include the Canadian Dollar, Euro, New Zealand Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Swedish Krona, Norwegian Krone and Chinese Renminbi.\nForeign group companies\nAs at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into Australian dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve within equity.\nWhen a foreign operation is sold, the cumulative exchange \ndifference in equity for this operation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as part of the gain and loss on sale.\nTransactions and balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the relevant entity at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subsequently translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, except for gains or losses arising on assets or liabilities that qualify for hedge accounting, discussed further in note 26.            Tax charges and credits attributable to these exchange differences are also recognised in equity. \nAverage exchange rates used in translating profit and loss items in \nF23 are:A$1 = US$ 0.673 (F22: US$ 0.726)A$1 = GB\u00a3 0.559 (F22: GB\u00a3 0.545) \nYear-end exchange rates used in translating financial position \nitems in F23 are:A$1 = US$ 0.662 (F22: US$ 0.688)A$1 = GB\u00a3 0.525 (F22: GB\u00a3 0.568)\nFair value measurement \nThe Group measures certain financial instruments, including derivatives, and certain non-financial assets such as agricultural assets, at fair value at each balance sheet date.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or \npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in its principal or most advantageous market at the measurement date. It is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial item assumes it is put to its highest and best use.\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in \nthe circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\nAccounting standards prescribe a fair value hierarchy, described \nas follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for \nidentical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input \nthat is significant to the fair value measurement is directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived by prices) observable.\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that \nis significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: About this report\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 1 - About this report (continued)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5156, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16ab1d63-04c7-41ff-9d96-ee1b9edbaf37": {"__data__": {"id_": "16ab1d63-04c7-41ff-9d96-ee1b9edbaf37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32be6c14-f87f-42c7-88d7-2b37672d8e30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "f9664536e067b313c92d9ad1f503dfafdeabd704bcb8ebd075f1f4784aa05945", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "86TREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nSegment accounting policies\nSegment assets and liabilities\nSegment assets and liabilities represent those working capital and non-current assets and liabilities which are located in the respective segments. Cash and borrowings, other than lease liabilities, are not considered to be segment assets/liabilities as they are managed by our centralised treasury function. Consistent with the use of EBITS for measuring profit, tax assets and liabilities, which do not contribute towards EBITS, are not allocated to operating segments.\nCorporate charges\nUnallocated corporate charges are reported in the Corporate/unallocated segment.  Net finance costs are not allocated to segments as the Group\u2019s financing function is centralised through its treasury function.\nSegment loans payable and loans receivable\nSegment loans are initially recognised at the amount transferred.  Intersegment loans receivable and payable that earn or incur non-market interest are adjusted to fair value based on market interest rates.  \nOtherIf items of revenue and expense are not allocated to operating segments, then any associated assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments either.The Group\u2019s segmentsThe Group reports segment information on the same basis as its internal management reporting structure and consistent with the information used to organise and manage the Group. \nDuring the current period, the business structure was reorganised \nto better reflect the Group\u2019s management of the Canadian operations, with a number of brands sold in Canada that are now managed by Treasury Premium Brands being remapped from Treasury Americas to Treasury Premium Brands. Comparatives have been restated to incorporate these changes. \nPresentation of segment results\nManagement EBITSThe principal profit metric for internal management reporting is Management earnings before interest, tax, SGARA and material items (EBITS). Corporate charges are allocated to each segment on a proportionate basis linked to segment revenue, head count or other appropriate driver depending on the nature of the charge.\n \nSGARA represents the difference between the fair value of \nharvested grapes (as determined under AASB 141 \nAgriculture) \nand the cost of harvested grapes. The fair value gain or loss is excluded from Management EBITS so that earnings can be assessed based on the cost of harvest, rather than their fair value.  \nThis approach results in a better reflection of the true nature of TWE\u2019s consumer branded and FMCG business and improved comparability with domestic and global peers. The F23 SGARA loss of $64.5 million includes the impact of a significant reduction in tonnage and yield from the 2023 Australian vintage, resulting in losses of $24.7 million.  The Group has the following reportable segments:\n(i)\n Penfolds\n This segment is responsible for the manufacturing, sale and  \nmarketing of Penfolds wine globaly. \n(ii)\n Treasury Premium Brands\n This segment is responsible for the manufacturing, sale and  \nmarketing of wine within Australia, Asia, Europe, Middle-East \nand Africa.  \n(iii)  Treasury Americas\n This segment is responsible for the manufacture, sale  \nand marketing of wine within North American and Latin Americas regions.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: About this report\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 2 -

The Group\u2019s contracts with customers generally include one performance obligation. Revenue from the sale of products or services is recognised at the point in time when control over a product or service is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery. Revenue is recorded net of sales discounts and rebates, duties and taxes. Payment terms vary by customer. The following specific criteria are also applied:\nWine\nRevenue is recognised in a manner that depicts transfer of control of goods to customers at the amount that reflects the consideration the business expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Sales to national retail chains, domestic distributors, independent retailers and on-premise outlets are usually recognised when goods are delivered. Sales to international customers are recognised based on the international commercial terms the goods are shipped under, but typically when goods are despatched. This is also the case for some national retail chains that manage their own distribution networks.  \nBottling servicesRevenue is recognised when the relevant service has\n \nbeen\u00a0completed.\nTrade discounts and volume rebatesProducts are often sold with volume discounts and other rebates. Sales are recorded based on the consideration specified in the sales contracts or terms, net of the estimated discount or rebate at the time of sale. These discounts or rebates are considered variable consideration and are accounted for in determining the transaction price of a contract. The method used by the Group to estimate discounts and rebates is the most likely amount. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates based on anticipated purchases and depletions.Net sales revenue \u2013 types of productsThe Group generates revenue through the sale of branded wines, principally as a finished, bottled product. The Group\u2019s wine portfolio includes some of the world\u2019s leading Luxury, Premium and Commercial wine brands such as Penfolds, Beringer, Lindeman\u2019s, Wolf Blass, 19 Crimes, Beaulieu Vineyard, Sterling Vineyards and Stags\u2019 Leap.  \n \nThe Group distributes wine to a range of customers across the world, with routes to market tailored by country. Depending on the geography, wine is sold to distributors, wholesalers, direct to national retail chains, independent retailers and on-premise outlets. The Group also has some sales direct to the consumer.  \nOther revenue Other revenue of the Group includes contract bottling services to third parties, sub-lease income and grape and bulk wine sales.  \nSales approach For F23, the Group had no customers whose revenues represented more than 10% of reported net sales revenue. For F22, there was one customer in Treasury Americas whose revenues represented 11.4% of reported net sales revenue. \nFinancing components  \nThe Group does not have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised product or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Consequently, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Earnings\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3631, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b4a9c85b-800f-4d71-9e6c-29443917f5ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "b4a9c85b-800f-4d71-9e6c-29443917f5ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0484191c-5ccf-4c71-876c-3b1fd7729f9c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "5d3d699690f56ac3793a3164c3f93a57acd6b5b78a6d886f94e0789bfd81c726", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "90\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Note 4 - Other earnings disclosures \n2023  \n$M2022  \n$M\nNet foreign exchange gains/(losses) 0.5 (0.6)\nSalaries and wages expense (386.5) (342.8)\nCosts associated with cloud computing arrangements (9.9) (7.2)\nShare based payments expense (13.8) (10.4)\nItems recognised as material items \u2013 refer note 5\nRestructuring and redundancy costs (82.6) (9.0)\n(Write-down)/reversal of write-down of assets (55.2) (3.2)\nNet profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment 34.4 (20.5)\nTransaction and integration costs (5.8) (12.8)\nOther itemsRestructuring and redundancy costs (0.3) (0.5)\nInsurance income 22.7 15.4\nNet profit on sale of property, plant and equipment 7.3 0.9\nTotal other gains and (losses) (79.5) (29.7)\nAccounting policies\nEmployee benefits\nEmployee benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave, bonuses, non-monetary benefits and share based payment expenses.

For trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach for expected credit losses, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of receivables. Expected credit losses are calculated by utilising a provision matrix where loss rates are calculated based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (for example geography, product type and rating). The provision matrix is initially determined by the Group\u2019s historical observed loss rates and calibrated for forward looking information. Loss rates will be updated at each reporting date based on changes in observed default rates and changes in forward looking information. \nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of their cost (using weighted average or FIFO basis) or estimated net realisable value. \nThe cost of raw materials is their purchase price or, in the case \nof grapes sourced from Group owned vineyards, fair value (see note 12 for further details). The cost of manufactured goods is determined on a consistent basis and is made up of the raw materials and direct labour used in manufacture. It also includes other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\nNet realisable value represents the estimated selling price \nin the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables including accruals are recorded when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of purchases of goods or services. Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.Key estimates and judgements \nTrade discounts and volume rebatesKey estimates relate to the amount accrued for discounts and rebates. Products are often sold with trade discounts and volume rebates. Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts or terms, net of the estimated discount or rebate at the time of sale. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and rebates based on anticipated purchases and depletions.\nNet realisable value of inventory\nThe period over which some wine inventories are converted from raw materials to finished goods can be a significant length of time. Failure to forecast demand effectively may result in excess inventories or missed revenue opportunities. \nForecast demand and market prices can vary significantly \nover the holding period up to the likely date of sale. Estimating the most likely conditions at the expected point of sale is therefore more challenging over the longer term. Non-current inventory is $1,175.3 million (F22: $1,063.6 million) and its estimated selling price is therefore a key estimate.

Non-lease components are distinct elements \nof a contract that are not related to securing the use of the leased\n \nasset, such as inventory, common area maintenance, and other management costs. The Group has elected to measure the amount disclosed in relation to variable leases for these arrangements by combining the lease and non-lease components.\n \nCertain leases include variable lease payments, including payments \nthat depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for\n \nitems such as grapes, labour, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes that will vary depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard.\nSuch variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of \nthe right-of-use asset and are recognised in the period in which the obligation is incurred.\nAccounting policies\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition of a lease in AASB 16 Leases.\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability \nat the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the \nstraight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of \nthe lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. \nThe Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by \nobtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease \nliability comprise the following:\n\u2022\n fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n\u2022\n variable lease payments that depend on an index or\na rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the \ncommencement date; \u2022 amounts expected to be payable under a residual value\nguarantee; and\n\u2022\n the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is\nreasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.\nThe lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a \ncorresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets as \u2018right-of-use \nassets\u2019 and lease liabilities in \u2018borrowings\u2019 in the consolidated statement

Intangible assets (continued)\nKey estimates and judgements\nUseful life of brand names\nIn assessing whether a brand has a finite or indefinite useful life, the Group makes use of information on the long-term strategy for the brand, the level of growth or decline of the markets that the brand operates in, the history of the market and the brand\u2019s position within that market.  \nIf a brand is assessed to have a finite life, the Group will use \njudgement in determining the useful life of the brand including the period over which expected cash flows will continue to be derived in making that decision.\nAccounting policies\nBrand names and licencesBrand names are recognised as assets when purchased individually and (primarily) as part of the allocation of the purchase price when the Group acquires other businesses. Internally generated brand names are not capitalised and expenditure incurred in developing, maintaining or enhancing brand names is charged to profit or loss in the year incurred.  \nBrand names are initially recognised at cost when purchased individually and at fair value when acquired with a business.  This fair value is determined by reference to independent valuations.  \nFollowing initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.  \nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses and represents the difference between the purchase price and share of the net assets of the acquired business, recorded at fair value.   \nFollowing initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually (see note 15).IT development and softwareOther than in relation to Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) arrangement, costs incurred in developing information technology (IT) products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and multi-year licenses are capitalised as intangible IT assets. They include the cost of purchased software and internal labour and contractors used in the development of software.  \nIT assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and are amortised over their expected useful life (2 -10 years) on a straight-line basis. Amortisation is included in \u2018Other expenses\u2019 in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.  \nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider\u2019s application software over the contract period.

Key estimates and judgements include:\nCash flow forecasts\nCash flow forecasts are based on the Group\u2019s most recent five-year financial plans approved by the Board. Key assumptions in the cash flow forecasts include sales volume growth, cost of sales and cost of doing business. \nThe Group\u2019s assumptions regarding sales volume growth \nand costs of doing business are based on expectations of the market demand and past experience. The assumption on cost of sales is based on expectation about future vintage costs which assume continuity of sourcing and access to fruit. \nThese estimates, judgements and assumptions are based on \nforecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions as at 30 June 2023 about future events that the Directors believe are reasonable in the circumstances.  \nLong-term growth rates\nCash flow forecasts beyond a five-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate range of 2.0% to 3.0% (F22: 2.0% to 3.0%). Growth rates are specific to individual CGUs and reflect expected future market and economic conditions.  \nDiscount ratesThe Group applies a post-tax discount rate to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method closely approximates applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows. The post-tax discount rates incorporate a risk-adjustment relative to the risks associated with the net post-tax cash flows being achieved. The following pre-tax discount rates were applied:Exchange ratesCash flow forecasts in foreign currency are forecast in that currency and discounted using the applicable regional discount rates (predominantly USD and GBP). \nSensitivity analysis \nIncreases in discount rates or changes in other key assumptions, such as operating conditions or financial performance, may cause the recoverable amount to fall below carrying values.  \nFor the TPB division, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value by $186 million. A reduction in cash flow forecasts of more than 26% for all years in the forecast period and also in the terminal year would reduce the CGU\u2019s headroom to nil. There are no reasonably possible changes in the discount rate that would result in an impairment.\n \nFor the remaining CGUs, based on current economic \nconditions and CGU performance, there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions used in the determination of CGU recoverable amounts that would result in an impairment to the Group.\n2023 2022\nPenfolds Americas 10.4% 9.0%\nPenfolds ANZ 10.4% 11.1%\nPenfolds EMEA 9.5% 10.5%\nTreasury Americas 10.0% 9.4%\nTreasury Premium Brands ANZ 10.7% 11.1%\nTreasury Premium Brands EMEA 10.0% 10.5%Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Operating assets and liabilities\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2990, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2fc05686-0804-4921-b346-94c8d0ffe888": {"__data__": {"id_": "2fc05686-0804-4921-b346-94c8d0ffe888", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2fddaa39-491c-49f9-ba7e-b76d58a63579", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "0550e451320a12ff1b000027e4fb3876db6c788404aa873c8e2c76963b7d0f26", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "105\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNote 16 - Provisions\n2023 \n$M2022 \n$M\nCurrent\nEmployee entitlements 39.2 42.8\nOther 62.5 33.5\nTotal current provisions 101.7 76.3\nOther provisions\n2023Supply contracts \n$MRestructuring\n$MOther\n$MTotal\n$M\nCarrying amount at start of year 1.5 4.8 27.2 33.5\nCharged/(credited) to profit or loss 31.5 26.2 6.1 63.8\nPayments - (8.1) (27.6) (35.7)\nForeign currency translation 0.1 0.1 0.7 0.9\nCarrying amount at end of year 33.1 23.0 6.4 62.5\nOther provisions include $5.2 million (F22: $26.2 million) in relation to estimated repair costs for a winery and vineyards that were damaged by wildfires in the Americas. \nSupply contract provisions are held for contracts that have been identified as being surplus to the Group\u2019s needs.

They are recognised only when it is probable the liability will arise and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.  \nIf the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate plus, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n \nEmployee entitlements\nLiabilities for employees\u2019 entitlements to wages and salaries, annual leave and other current employee entitlements (that are expected to be paid within 12 months) are measured at amounts expected to be paid as at the reporting date.\nLiabilities for other employee entitlements, which are not \nexpected to be paid or settled within 12 months of reporting date, are accrued in respect of all employees at the present value of future amounts expected to be paid.RestructuringRestructuring provisions are recognised at the point when a detailed plan for the restructure has been developed and implementation has commenced. The cost of restructuring provided is the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the appropriate rate which reflects the risks of the cash flow.\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is \nterminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of a current employee according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal or upon the provision of an offer to encourage voluntary redundancy.\nSupply contracts\nSupply contracts provisions are measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract (discounted to present value if material).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3025, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3fd6c26-2b02-48b3-8548-7cebe00ae09f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3fd6c26-2b02-48b3-8548-7cebe00ae09f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0d859ad9-1f35-4465-8871-724df76620f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "fc36fec7a7b9a95c214dd52bcd44924543a464026282af56bcacc1713df6f34a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "106\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Note 17 - Capital management\nNote 18 - Borrowings The Group considers capital to be the combination of shareholders\u2019 \nequity, reserves and net debt.

For employees enrolling in the 2021-2023 plans, the Group will deliver one matched share for every purchased share held at the plan vesting date, subject to continued employment.\n \nParticipants are entitled to dividends and to exercise voting rights \nattached to the shares purchased under the plan, and matched shares once they have been allocated.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Capital structure\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3262, "end_char_idx": 5333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "143052bf-c86a-439f-a5bf-1696ce05fa70": {"__data__": {"id_": "143052bf-c86a-439f-a5bf-1696ce05fa70", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ca5f5c4-f637-4114-b7fb-eb2d8105e1bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "c38482467a70a3b7a583a2ef788c00c004f2bda5348baa1a448aa050e26cf7b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "110\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Active share-based payment plans:\nLong-term Incentive Plans\nThe below table outlines the F23 and F22 LTIP plans which have a vesting date post 30 June 2023:\nThe below table outlines the F23 GLG LTIP plan which has a vesting date post 30 June 2023:Grant dateF23 Plan\n1-Nov-22 F22 Plan\n1-Dec-21  \nGrant date share price $13.03 $11.79\nExpected share price volatility (%) 40.0 42.0\nExpected dividend yield (%) 2.6 2.7\nRisk-free interest rate (%) 3.36 0.77\nFair value estimate at grant date - TSR $9.12 $7.39\nFair value estimate at grant date - ROCE $12.16 $11.00\nFair value estimate at grant date - EPS $12.16 -\nGrant dateF23 Plan\n1-Oct-22 \nGrant date share price $12.57\nExpected dividend yield (%) 2.6\nFair value estimate at grant date \u2013 EBITS & EBITS Margin $11.70\nFair value estimate time-based \u2013 Vesting F23: 2025 $11.65Note 22 - Employee equity plans (continued)\nAccounting policies\nEmployee equity plans are accounted for as share based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for the awards. \nThe fair value of the shares and performance rights that are expected to vest is progressively recognised as an employee benefits expense over the relevant vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.\nThe fair value of shares granted is determined by reference to observed market values.

The Group fully cooperates with these enquiries as and when they arise.\nOECD global minimum tax framework\nThe Group operates in two countries (Japan and the United Kingdom) which have either enacted or substantively enacted new tax legislation to implement the Pillar Two global minimum top-up tax (top-up tax). The Group does not expect to be subject to material top-up tax in relation to its operations in any of these countries as the effective tax rate is expected to be greater than 15%. The newly enacted tax legislation in these countries is effective only from years commencing from 1 January 2024. \nThe Group has applied a temporary mandatory relief from deferred \ntax accounting for the impacts of the top-up tax and will account for it as a current tax if it is incurred from 1 July 2024 (see Note 33).  Key estimate and judgement\nTaxationThe Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and jurisdictions where it has foreign operations. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting policies\nCurrent taxesCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, taxation authorities at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred taxes\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent it is probable that they will be utilised.\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at \neach reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it will become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed \nat balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilise them.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the \ntax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at balance sheet date between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, other than for:\n\u2022\n The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction\n \nthat is not a business combination and at the time of \nthe transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss or on the recognition of goodwill.\n\u2022\n Foreign taxes which may arise in the event of retained\n \nprofits of foreign controlled entities being remitted to Australia as there is no present intention to make any such remittances.\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities associated with \nindefinite life intangibles such as brand names are measured based on the tax consequences that would follow from the use and sale of that asset. \nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are \nrecognised in equity and not in profit or loss.\nOffsetting deferred tax balances\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.Note 24 -Income tax (continued)Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Taxation\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "231b3bab-997c-4118-9f5f-ab49dc1f18a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "231b3bab-997c-4118-9f5f-ab49dc1f18a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6e7e256-77bd-45a1-8d09-2b15d8cb92c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "118", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "569e76f0a61923d69abc40f0fc669882314b2c09984f57b89317e497eccbbc99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "115\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023\nNote 25 - Financial risk management \nFinancial risk management framework \nThe Group\u2019s financial risk management policies (\u2018Group Treasury Policies\u2019) cover risk tolerance, internal controls (including segregation of duties), delegated authority levels, management of foreign currency, interest rate and counterparty credit exposures, and the reporting of exposures.

The Group\u2019s objective is to balance continuity of funding and flexibility by maintaining an appropriately structured debt maturity profile with a mix of bank and capital (bond) market debt, whilst also monitoring compliance with the Group\u2019s key financial covenants and undertakings.Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Risk\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2590, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bec7a59f-8a78-4ece-ab71-bee919e17d73": {"__data__": {"id_": "bec7a59f-8a78-4ece-ab71-bee919e17d73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83a451b1-04cd-4946-af1d-8d248ab286d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "d3e3610aa98fb2a7ea386e09c796081d20e0612465a751bb4e30aa4eeddec31e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "032f3abb-0213-4ef3-95a3-9dcf34a55d98", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ec45ba93f6262102bfa661f0b47f17ac72c45347916bec4c093a4d78a9c5add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "116\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023Level of exposure at balance date\nThe following tables analyse the maturities of the Group\u2019s contractual undiscounted cash flows arising from its material financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments.\nMaturing in:\n6 months \nor less\n$M6 months\nto 1 year\n$M1 to 2 \nyears\n$M2 to 5\nyears\n$MOver\n5 years\n$MContractual\ntotal\n$MCarrying \namount\n$M\n2023\nNon-derivative financial liabilitiesBank loans\n118.4 18.1 30.4 585.5 - 652.4 539.8\nLease liabilities 40.2 45.3 89.2 234.8 306.5 716.0 548.9\nOther loans - - 0.5 - - 0.5 0.5\nUS Private Placement Notes 205.5 11.6 23.2 281.9 518.0 1,040.2 868.6\nTrade payables 339.9 - - - - 339.9 339.9\nOther payables 369.8 - - - - 369.8 369.8\nDerivative financial liabilitiesForeign exchange contracts 3.6 3.0 2.8 0.4 - 9.8 9.8\nInterest rate and cross currency swaps 5.0 6.7 10.6 2.5 0.4 25.2 20.3\nTotal financial liabilities 982.4 84.7 156.7 1,105.1 824.9 3,153.8 2,696.7\n 2022Non-derivative financial liabilitiesBank loans\n110.6 114.8 18.3 243.9 342.1 729.7 603.5\nLease liabilities 40.4 46.4 89.7 250.5 385.1 812.1 609.0\nOther loans - - 0.5 - - 0.5 0.5\nUS Private Placement Notes 9.7 9.7 197.1 247.4 78.2 542.1 472.2\nTrade payables 314.9 - - - - 314.9 314.9\nOther payables 432.3 - - - - 432.3 432.3\n Derivative financial liabilitiesForeign exchange contracts 2.1 1.0 4.1 2.5 - 9.7 9.7\nInterest rate and cross currency swaps 2.0 6.8 17.8 34.9 2.7 64.2 11.3\nTotal financial liabilities 812.0 178.7 327.5 779.2 808.1 2,905.5 2,453.4\n1.

Where available, credit opinions on counterparties from two credit rating agencies are used to determine credit limits.\nThe Group assesses the credit quality of individual customers prior \nto offering credit terms and continues to monitor on a regular basis. Each customer is assigned a risk profile based upon the measurable risk indicators for dishonoured payments, adverse information and average days late along with the securities and guarantees held. All prospective accounts are required to complete a credit application and generally a director\u2019s guarantee is required with minimal exceptions. Failure to provide a director\u2019s guarantee results in either no credit or a limited level of credit offered. Credit terms may be reduced or extended for individual customers based on risk.\nIn F23 the Group, as part of its normal monitoring of the credit quality \nof trade receivables, continued frequent telephone contact and engagement with customers to understand customer trading and credit circumstances, and supporting them through any short-term challenges identified. The Group also continued to monitor customer credit risk assessments across the entire customer portfolio. \nPast due accounts are subject to a number of collection activities \nwhich range from telephone contact, suspension of orders through to legal action. Past due accounts are reviewed monthly with specific focus on accounts that are greater than 90 days overdue.  \nWhere debt cannot be recovered, it is escalated from the credit representative to the credit manager to initiate recovery action.\nFor derivatives, the Group transacts under an International Swaps\n \nand Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement. If a \ncredit event such as a default occurs, all outstanding transactions under an ISDA agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is payable in settlement of all transactions. \n \nLevel of exposure at balance date\nThe maximum counterparty credit risk exposure at 30 June 2023 in\n \nrespect of derivative financial instruments was $23.3 million (F22: $22.0 million) and in respect of cash and cash equivalents was $113.9 million (F22: $186.2 million). The Group\u2019s authorised counterparties are restricted to banks and financial institutions whose long-term credit rating is at or above a Standard and Poors rating of A- (or Moody\u2019s equivalent rating of A3), with any exceptions requiring approval from the Board.

The past due receivables shown above relate to customers who have a good debt history and are considered recoverable.  There is no collateral held as security against the receivables above and there are no other receivables past due. \nNote 26 - Derivative financial instruments\nAt reporting date, there were $556.9 million (Australian dollar equivalent) net face value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts at contract rates (F22: $385.4 million), interest rate swaps of $1,021.1 million (F22: $857.2 million) and cross currency interest rate swaps of $181.3 million (F22: $174.4 million) and interest rate collars of nil (F22: $203.4 million). These instruments are regarded as Level 2 under AASB\u2019s Fair Value measurement hierarchy.\nNote 27 - Fair values\nThe fair value of the US Private Placement Notes is $904.8 million (F22: $484.1 million) and the fair value of the syndicated debt facility is $552.7 million (F22: $644.3 million). The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and other financial liabilities approximate their carrying value. There have been no reclassifications of financial assets from fair value to cost, or from cost or amortised cost to fair value during the year.\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments are based upon \nmarket prices, or models using inputs observed from the market, where markets exist or have been determined by discounting the expected future cash flows by the current interest rate for financial assets and financial liabilities with similar risk profiles (a Level 2 valuation).\nThe valuation of derivative financial assets and liabilities reflects \nthe estimated amounts which the Group would be required to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (net of transaction costs) or replace the contracts at their current market rates at reporting date.  This is based on internal valuations using standard valuation techniques. \nAs the purpose of these derivative financial instruments is to hedge \nthe Group\u2019s underlying assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and to hedge against risk of interest rate fluctuations, it is unlikely in the absence of abnormal circumstances that these contracts would be terminated prior to maturity.For all other recognised financial assets and financial liabilities, based on the facts and circumstances existing at reporting date and the nature of the Group\u2019s financial assets and financial liabilities including hedge positions, the Group has no reason to believe that the financial assets could not be exchanged, or the financial liabilities could not be settled, in an arm\u2019s length transaction at an amount approximating its carrying amount.(d)  Credit risk (continued)The ageing of the consolidated Group trade receivables (net of provisions) is outlined below:\n2023\n$M2022\n$M\nNot past due 378.5 387.7\nPast due 1-30 days 50.9 25.4\nPast due 31-60 days 5.6 4.3\nPast due 61 days+ 5.9 2.5\nTotal 440.9 419.9Notes to the consolidated financial statements: Risk\nFor the year ended 30 June 2023\nNote 25 - Financial risk management (continued)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "582471b1-b9cf-4230-b979-1b0f45829fa3": {"__data__": {"id_": "582471b1-b9cf-4230-b979-1b0f45829fa3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9531c39d-c723-433c-8691-c39728455154", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_path": "/home/ag/projects/wine-ads/app/data/twe-annual-report-2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 7891500, "creation_date": "2024-10-03", "last_modified_date": "2024-10-03"}, "hash": "7f3f6fc040a084506c9545489d4b024f0839044daf7583cdeab9251afc76cead", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "122\nTREASURY WINE ESTATES ANNUAL REPORT 2023The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the following subsidiaries:Note 28 - Subsidiaries\nEntity name Country of incorporation \nEquity holding of 100% (F21: 100%)\nAldershot Nominees Pty.

This is determined on initial recognition. \nFinancial assets classified as at amortised cost are measured \ninitially at fair value and adjusted in respect of any incremental and directly attributable transaction costs. All other financial assets are measured at fair value on initial recognition. \nReclassification occurs only if there are fundamental changes \nto the Group\u2019s business model for managing financial assets.\nAmortised cost  \nA financial asset is classified as at amortised cost only if \nthe asset is held to collect contractual cash flows and the\n \ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost using the \neffective interest rate method. Any gains and losses are recognised through the amortisation process or when the financial asset is derecognised or impaired.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are determined using historical recovery of contractual cash flows and the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for current economic and credit conditions. An impairment loss is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. Impairment losses on assets classified as amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss when they are expected, not when they are incurred. If a later event causes the impairment loss to decrease, the amount is reversed in profit or loss. \nDerecognition of financial assets  \nThe derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the \nGroup no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise\n \nthe financial instrument. \nThis is normally the case when the instrument is sold or all the \ncash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party. Other accounting policiesDerivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps and options to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and are financial assets when the fair value is positive and financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any \ngains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year. \nHedge accounting\nFor the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction; or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.\nInitial recognition\nAt the beginning of a hedge relationship, the Group designates and documents the hedge relationship and the related risk management objective and strategy.  The documentation identifies the hedging instrument and the hedged item as well as describing the economic relationship, the hedge ratio between them and potential sources of ineffectiveness. The documentation also includes the nature of the risk being hedged and the method of assessing the hedging instrument\u2019s effectiveness.

The Directors have given consideration to such matters which are or may be subject to claims or litigation at year end and are of the opinion that any liabilities arising over and above already provided in the financial statements from such action would not have a material effect on the Group\u2019s financial performance.\nIt is not practical to estimate the potential effect of these matters \nhowever the Group believe that it is not probable that a significant liability will arise.\nClass actions\nTwo Australian shareholder class actions have been commenced against TWE Limited.  The first action was served on 2 April 2020 by Slater & Gordon (S&G) acting for Brett Stallard as trustee for the Stallard superannuation fund. The second action was served on 1 May 2020 by Maurice Blackburn (MB) acting for Steven Napier. The class in both proceedings comprise shareholders who purchased shares between 30 June 2018 and 28 January 2020. The two actions were consolidated into a single action on 15 October 2020. TWE filed its Defence on 25 February 2021. On 21 April 2023, the joint plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Statement of Claim (ASOC). The proceedings allege that the Company breached its continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX Listing Rules and the Corporations Act and that it engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Corporations Act and the ASIC Act.   Regarding the claims, the Company strongly denies any and all allegations made against it and is vigorously defending the proceedings.

If the call option is exercised it will result in a payment to Duxton Water Limited.  \nVineyard acquisition\nThe Group has entered into a contract to purchase vineyard assets  \nin Australia and New Zealand for approximately $50 million.
